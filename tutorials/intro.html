<p>These tutorials introduce you to assembly language programming on the 
<script>writeLongMachineName()</script>
 (<script>wMAbr()</script>). 
 The <script>wMAbr()</script>
  has been configured for this course as a complete
  programming environment, featuring the 
  <script>writeProcessorName()</script>
  , the Linux operating system,
  and selected GNU programming utilities (compiler, assembler, linker, 
  make, and  debugger). This document provides an overview of the
  hardware and interface. The links at the top lead to the tutorials themselves,
  or you can use the <a href="./">browse</a> 
  link to view source code and other text files. You may download a .zip file
  of all the tutorials through <a href="../tutorials.zip">this link</a>.</p>
<h4>Installing Software</h4>
<p>Before you begin to program the 
  <script>wMAbr()</script>
  , you will need to install some
  software on your own computer:</p>
<ol>
  <li>A text editor allows you to write your programs.  For Windows, <a href="http://winscp.net/" target="download">WinSCP</a> has
    an adequate text
    editor built in.  For the Macintosh,
    <a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/TextWrangler/" target="download">TextWrangler</a><a href="http://cyberduck.ch/" target="download"></a> works
  well. You are welcome to use other text editors, but a few features are important:
  <ol type="a">
    <li>The editor should display line numbers, since your compiler will use
      them to report errors.</li>
    <li>The editor should be able to save files with Unix line endings. Linux
      utilities expect each line to end wih a single LF character, but many Windows editors
      end lines with two characters, CR and LF. (Ancient Mac programs ended lines
      with CR, but this practice ended with OS X). Voluminous
      compiler errors
      are generated by the extra CR's.</li>
  </ol>
  </li>
  <li>A Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) client allows you to save files
    on the 
    <script>wMAbr()</script>
    . Ideally, the SFTP client is integrated with a text editor, so that you
    can edit files on your machine and each save immediately updates the remote
    copy. For Windows, a good free SFTP client is <a href="http://winscp.net/" target="download">WinSCP</a>.
    For the Macintosh, <a href="http://cyberduck.ch/" target="download">CyberDuck</a> works
    well; install TextWrangler first, then use the CyberDuck preferences to edit
    text files with TextWrangler.</li>
  <li>An Secure SHell (SSH) client  allows you to compile and run your programs,
    and observe the results. For Windows, <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/">PuTTY</a> is
    a good free ssh client. For the Macintosh, Terminal is a built-in application
    that works fine.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Finding the Tutorials</h4>
<p>You will be given a User ID and password in class. Begin with your SFTP client;
connect to <a href="sftp://csc.belmont.edu/">csc.belmont.edu</a>, and log in with your User ID and
password. </p>
<p>The
  tutorials are pre-loaded in your account, in the folder <span class="sourcecode">private/csc2110/tutorials</span>.
  The first tutorial will show you how to find them. The master copy is 
  available at <a href="https://csc.belmont.edu/%7Ehooper/csc211/zaurus/tutorials"> 
https://csc.belmont.edu/hooper/csc2110/tutorials</a>. </p>
<p><strong>Using Your Own Machine</strong></p>
<p>These instructions assume that you will use the machine provided by your instructor.
  The 
  <script>writeLongMachineName()</script> 
  is inexpensive, however, and you are welcome to copy these tutorials to your
  own machine and work on them there, so long as you follow the submission procedure
  outlined below. I kept an <a href="help/installation-log.html">installation
  log</a> as
  I set up the machine for this class, which you are welcome to browse for pointers. </p>
<p><b>What to Submit</b></p>
<p>These tutorials require you to experiment, observe, and reflect. It is assumed 
  that you will work through the activities as you read these instructions. Unnumbered 
  questions on the following pages are for your observation and reflection; do 
  not turn in the answers. The questions in the section called <b>Self Test</b> 
  are also just that; do not turn their answers in, either.</p>
<p>The section called <b>Assignment</b> describes the work to be turned in. The 
  assignments are designated with the letters a, b, c, ... etc. You will be given 
  a letter in class, for the one you will turn in. You are encouraged to do others, 
  but you are only responsible for one. </p>
<p>Suppose you are to do assignment for <u><em>a</em></u><b><u>.</u></b> for
  Tutorial 1. This tutorial uses the files 
  <a href="t1m.cpp" target="t1m">t1m.cpp</a> (C++) and 
  <a href="t1.s" target="t1">t1.s</a> (assembly),
  and you will be responsible for submitting both types of files as well. Name
   your  C++ file <b>t1s</b><u><em>a</em></u><b>m.cpp</b> and your assembly file <b>t1s</b><u><em>a</em></u><b>.s</b>.
  When you run the program, some tutorials also ask you to copy the terminal
   session into a file call <strong>t1s</strong><u><em>a</em></u><strong>.log</strong>.
   Mail these files as attachments:</p>
<pre><a href="mailto:william.hooper@belmont.edu?subject=t1sa"">To: william.hooper@belmont.edu
Subject: t1s<em>a</em></a></pre>

<p><b>So, Let's Begin!</b></p>
<p>The instructions for first tutorial are found <a href="t0/instructions.html">here</a>, and the rest can be reached
  from the links at the <a href="#top">top</a> 
  of this page. Good luck!</p>
