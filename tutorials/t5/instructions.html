<h1>t5: Shift Operations</h1>
<script>wNavbar()</script>
<p> This tutorial displays some practical uses of the shift operator. It is often 
  important to change the format of data, for communications, storage, or presentation. 
  These format changes often involve shift, AND and OR operations arranged so 
  as to move bits within one set of words into another. This particular program 
  takes a string of octal digits, and converts them into an integer value. <IMG SRC="Image7.gif" WIDTH=254 HEIGHT=88 ALIGN="RIGHT" HSPACE=9 VSPACE=9> 
</p>
<P>The conversion process is illustrated in the example to the right. The original 
  string "45", is to be interpreted as 45<sub>8</sub>, equivalent to 37<sub>10</sub>. 
  Conveniently, the ASCII code for the digit '4' ends with the bits 100, which 
  is the binary code for four. Likewise, the ASCII '5' ends in 101, which encodes 
  five; this correspondence holds for all ASCII digits. When the two bit patterns 
  are assembled together, the result, 100101<sub>2</sub>, is the bit pattern for 
  37<sub>10</sub>. </P>
<P>Note that the program really converts from octal to binary. Once the data is 
  in native binary format, the C++ output library makes the binary-decimal 
  conversion. The main program 
  <a href="t5m.cpp" target="t5m">t5m.cpp</a> is unremarkable; 
  but <a href="t5.s" target="t5">t5.s</a> merits some explanation: </P>
<div class="hangingindent"> 
  <P> 21: The immediate argument #7 has the binary pattern 00000111<sub>2</sub>,
     i.e., the rightmost three bits of the word. ANDing this pattern with the
    character in 
    <span class="register">r2</span>
    clears all but the rightmost three bits.</P>
  <P>22: A lot happens in this one instruction! Beginning 
    on the right, the shift operation 
    <span class="sourcecode">lsl#3</span>
    makes way for new bits by moving the previous bits of 
    <span class="register">r1</span> three places
    to the right. This is equivalent to multiplying 
    <span class="register">r5</span> by 8, but the shift is
    faster and, to experienced coders, more obvious. The shifted operand is then
    OR'd with the three-bit pattern in 
    <span class="register">r2</span>.</P>
</div>
<P> Make and run this program, and verify that it does indeed convert 45<sub>8</sub> 
  to 37<sub>10</sub>, 100<sub>8</sub> to 64<sub>10</sub>, etc. Then, use gdb
  to trace the operation of the program. Stepping through the loop, you should
  be  able to watch the bits transferred from the string to
  <span class="register">r2</span>, then ORed
  into 
  <span class="register">r1</span>. <b>Warning:</b> be sure to continue before
  you execute line 29. When the address in <span class="register">r0</span> is
  replaced by the return value, string display is no longer valid. The attempt
  to display a string from an arbitrary address (e.g. 37) can crash gdb.</P>
<P><b>Self-Test</b></P>
<ol>
  <li> (3) Assume this function is called with the string "631" as an argument.
    List each change in the value of 
    <span class="register">r5</span> that occurs during execution of the 
    function.</li>
  <li> (3) Note that nothing in the program actually checks that the string
    is all octal digits. What number will the program return if the user enters
    the string: <span class="userTyped">Hi!</span>?</li>
  <li> (2) What's the largest octal number that can be processed correctly
    by this program? What happens if you enter a (valid octal) number that is
    too large or too small?</li>
</ol>
<P><b>Assignment</b></P>
<ol class="assignment">
  <li><span class="sourcecode">int BinToInt(char* S)</span> returns the integer represented by binary
    string S.</li>
  <li><span class="sourcecode">int DecToInt(char* S)</span> returns the integer represented by decimal
      string S.<BR>
    (Hint: don't shift, multiply)</li>
  <li><span class="sourcecode">int HexToInt(char* S)</span> returns the integer represented by hexadecimal
      string S.<BR>
    (Hint: test for characters 'A'-'F', and convert them separately.)</li>
  <li> <span class="sourcecode">void encode(char* P, char* C)</span> copies plaintext P to cyphertext C, changing
      each character by rolling the lower five bits one position left. For example,
    if P = "<span class="sourcecode">Hi.</span>", encode() would copy <span class="sourcecode">Dt'</span> into C, since:</li>
<IMG SRC="encode.gif" WIDTH=266 HEIGHT=100 align="CENTER"><br>
<li> <span class="sourcecode">void IntToOct(N, char* S)</span> copies into string S the octal representation
     of N.</li>
  <li><span class="sourcecode"> void IntToHex(N, char* S)</span> copies into string S the hexadecimal representation
    of N.</li>
  <li> <span class="sourcecode">void IntToBin(N, char* S)</span> copies into string S the binary representation
of N.</li></ol>

<P class="hangingindent">Why do so many programmers confuse Halloween with Christmas? </P>
<P class="hangingindent">Because 31<sub>Oct</sub> = 25<sub>Dec</sub></P>
