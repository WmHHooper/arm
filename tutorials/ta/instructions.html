<h1>ta: Floating-Point Formats</h1>
<script>wNavbar()</script>
<p>This tutorial illustrates the two floating-point formats recognized by the 
  <script>writeProcessorName()</script>
  . Double-precision is a 64-bit format, while single-precision uses 32 
  bits. Both formats conform to the IEEE 754 standard for floating-point numbers. 
  <a href="ta.s" target="ta">ta.s</a> converts
  a double-precision number to single-precision. 
  <a href="tam.cpp" target="tam">tam.cpp</a>,
  the main program, stores values in a double-precision variable, calls the
  conversion procedure, then prints the single-precision result to verify the
  conversion. </p>
<p>The  instruction set of the 
  <script>writeProcessorName()</script>
in your 
<script>writeLongMachineName()</script> 
makes this program obsolete, as it contains a complete vector floating point
(VFP) processor. Cheaper and simpler versions of the ARM, however, still use
software conversion routines like this; when an ARM processor without floating-point
hardware executes an instruction like <span class="sourcecode">fmadd</span>,
an illegal instruction exception triggers an exception handler, which looks up
the instruction and performs the floating point operation in software. </p>
<p>The main program 
  <a href="tam.cpp" target="tam">tam.cpp</a> is straightforward.
  Some notes about the function in 
  <a href="ta.s" target="ta">ta.s</a> are
  as follows:</p>
<div class="hangingindent"> 
  <p>15: Move the 64-bit double-precision bit pattern into  integer registers.
    This instruction transfers the least significant bits of 
    <span class="register">d0</span> into 
    <span class="register">r1</span>, and
    the most significant bits into 
    <span class="register">r2</span>. Registers 
    <span class="register">d0..d15</span> and 
    <span class="register">s0..s15</span> cannot be
    manipulated with the bit-wise operators we use to separate signs, exponents,
    and mantissas. Instead, we use their addresses to move them between memory
  and the integer registers, bypassing the FPR&#146;s.</p>
  <p>17-19: Assemble the 23-bit mantissa from the 20 least significant bits of
    <span class="register">r2</span> and the three most significant bits of 
    <span class="register">r1</span>.</p>
<p> 21-24: Calculate the exponent. The
  original exponent is 11 bits, while the new exponent is only eight. We convert 
  <span class="register">r3</span> from
    excess-1023  to excess-127 notation by subtracting 896 
    (<span class="sourcecode">r3 - 1023 + 127 = r3 - 896</span>).</p>
  <p> 26-27: Copy the sign bit from 
  <span class="register">r2</span> to 
  <span class="register">r0</span>.</p>
  <p> 29: Move the completed bit pattern to 
  <span class="register">s0</span>, 
  the return register for single-precision floating point.</p>
</div>
<p> Compile and run this program. Enter various floating-point values and see
   which of them are properly converted. Note the format for input in scientific
   notation: enter 200,000,000,000 as <span class="sourcecode">2.0e11</span>. What is the largest
   value that converts correctly? What happens if you enter a value too large?
   What fractions convert correctly, and what errors do you have? what is the
   smallest value that converts correctly? What happens if you enter a value
   too small?   </p>
<p> When you are satisfied that you understand the responses of the program,
  use the 
  <span class="userTyped">gdb ta</span>,
  set a breakpoint at <span class="sourcecode">DoubleToSingle</span>, enter run
  at the <span class="sourcecode">(gdb)</span> prompt, and enter <span class="userTyped">-1.2</span> at
  the <span class="sourcecode">&gt;</span> prompt. The debugger output will display
  the input value and the next instruction:</p>
<pre>9: /f $d0 = -1.2
...
=&gt; 0x8978 &lt;DoubleToSingle&gt;:     vmov    r1, r2, d0</pre>
<p>Compare the instruction to line 15 of 
  <a href="ta.s" target="ta">ta.s</a>. The
  debugger is using Vector Floating Point (VFP) mnemonics to disassemble your
  program. These are equivalent to the floating point mnemonics we used to write
  the program; a translation can be found in the 
  <a href="../intro.html#ref" target="intro">ARM Architecture Reference Manual</a>. 
  Step forward an instruction, and note the
  change in 
  <span class="register">r1..r2</span>:</p>
<pre>...
6: /x $r1 = 0x33333333<br>5: /x $r2 = 0xbff33333
...</pre>
<p>Concatenating these two registers, we see the IEEE 754 representation of the
  value in 
  <span class="register">d0</span>: a sign bit of 
  <span class="sourcecode">1<sub>2</sub></span>, an exponent of 
  <span class="sourcecode">01111111111<sub>2</sub></span>, and a
  repeating mantissa of 
  <span class="sourcecode">1.0011...<sub>2</sub></span> 
  (remember that the leading
  <span class="sourcecode">1.</span>
  bit of the mantissa is hidden). Stepping through the next three instructions, we  observe:</p>
<pre>...
7: /x $r0 = 0x199999
...</pre>
<p>that 23 bits of the mantissa have been copied
into the least significant bits of 
<span class="register">r0</span>. As we step through the next four instructions,
we see the exponent 
<span class="sourcecode">0x3ff</span> copied into 
<span class="register">r3</span>, then converted to 
<span class="sourcecode">0x7f</span>, the equivalent
representation in single-precision, and copied into bits 30-23 or 
<span class="register">r0</span>:</p>
<pre>...
7: /x $r0 = 0x3f999999<br>...<br>4: /x $r3 = 0x7f
...</pre>
<p>Two more instructions, and we see the sign bit copied into 
  <span class="register">r3</span>,
  and back into bit 31 of 
  <span class="register">r0</span>:</p>
<pre>...
7: /x $r0 = 0xbf999999<br>...<br>4: /x $r3 = 0x1
...</pre>
<p>Finally, we see 
  <span class="register">r0</span>
  copied to
  <span class="register">s0</span>:</p>
<pre>...
8: /f $s0 = -1.19999993<br>7: /x $r0 = 0xbf999999
...</pre>
<p>and that the value has suffered
  a little in translation. Enter <span class="userTyped">continue</span>, and
  the program prints:</p>
<pre>-1.2(D) = -1.19999993(F)</pre>
<p>a value which reflects one limitation of the single-precision floating point format. </p>
<p>Step through another conversion on your own, and predict the results of each
  step in the conversion. Enter <span class="userTyped">q</span> at the <span class="sourcecode">&gt;</span> prompt to halt the program, and <span class="userTyped">quit</span> at the <span class="sourcecode">(gdb)</span> prompt to exit the debugger.</p>
<p><b>Self-Test</b></p>
<ol>
  <li>(6) Trace the execution of <span class="sourcecode">DoubleToSingle()</span>when
      D = 0.375 . List each value assigned to 
      <span class="register">r3</span> and 
      <span class="register">r0</span>,
    and explain its significance.</li>
  <li>(2) Explain what happens when D = 0, and why.</li>
  <li>(2) What is the largest number that <span class="sourcecode">DoubleToSingle()</span> will
    correctly convert? Explain.</li>
</ol>

<p><b>Assignments</b></p>
<p>For each of these assignments, move your floating point arguments into integer
  registers,  use integer arithmetic and logical operations to make the required
  conversions, then move them back into the needed floating-point registers.</p>
<ol class="assignment">
  <li>Modify <span class="sourcecode">DoubleToSingle()</span> to return the values
    7F800000<sub>16</sub> 
    or FF800000<sub>16</sub> (+/- INF), whenever D has a value too large
     to express in single-precision.</li>
  <li>Modify <span class="sourcecode">DoubleToSingle()</span> to return the values
    00000000<sub>16</sub> or 80000000<sub>16</sub> (+/- 0), whenever
    D has a value too small to express in single-precision (represent denormalized
    numbers as zeroes).</li>
  <li>Modify <span class="sourcecode">DoubleToSingle() </span>to store denormalized
    values, when converting double-precision numbers in the appropriate range.</li>
  <li>Modify <span class="sourcecode">DoubleToSingle()</span> to
