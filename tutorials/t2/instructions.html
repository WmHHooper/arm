<h1>t2: Labels and Branch Instructions</h1>
<script>wNavbar()</script>
<P>This tutorial introduces branching, the mechanism used to implement both if/then/else
   decision statements and loop constructs of all kinds. To begin this tutorial,
   change your directory to t2 and review the files 
  <a href="t2m.cpp" target="t2m">t2m.cpp</a> and 
  <a href="t2.s" target="t2">t2.s</a>. The C++ file is very similar to that in
  the previous  tutorials; let's examine
  <a href="t2.s" target="t2">t2.s</a>:</P>
<div class="hangingindent"> 
  <P> 16: The comparison commands are described in sections 2.4, 3.3.1, and B.1.1
     of the text. In this example, the <span class="sourcecode">cmp</span> instruction
     compares register 
<span class="register">r1</span> (the exponent) with zero.</P>
  <P> 18: One of unusual features of the ARM architecture is that practically
     every instruction can be made conditional. The <span class="sourcecode">movlt</span> instruction
      takes advantage of that feature, setting the return value to zero--but
     only  if the exponent is negative. </P>
  <P>&#9;19: This is a more conventional branch instruction. The branch will
    either be taken (skipping the exponent calculation) if the exponent is less
    than or equal to zero. Note that both <span class="sourcecode">movlt</span> and <span class="sourcecode">ble</span> instructions use
    the result of the same test, the comparison in line 15.</P>
  <P>22-24: The <span class="sourcecode">subs</span> instruction
    decrements
<span class="register">r1</span>, with the side effect  of setting the condition codes. The 
<span class="sourcecode">bgt</span> instruction
    uses the condition  to loop backwards only when
<span class="register">r1</span> is greater than zero.
    When
<span class="register">r1</span> reaches zero, the 
<span class="sourcecode">gt</span> condition
    is false, and execution falls through the branch to the return code that
    follows.</P>
</div>
<p>You should run the program at this point, entering various combinations 
  of X and N to check the results. The program should correctly raise integers
   to positive integer powers, while truncating negative powers to zero. Enter
   an noninteger for X, and the program will quit. </p>
<p><strong>gdb.ini</strong></p>
<p>Before we  use the debugger, let's see how setup commands
  work. In each directory, the file named <a href="gdb.ini" target="gdb">gdb.ini</a> contains
  a list of gdb commands. Each time gdb runs, these commands are read and executed,
  just as though you had typed them in at the beginning of your debugging session.
  The commands in the gdb.ini file for this tutorial display registers
  <span class="register">r0..r3</span>
  and the 
  <span class="register">cpsr</span> as hexadecimal values, and the 
  <span class="register">pc</span>
  as a pointer to an instruction.
  In writing the file, I attempted to anticipate the information you will need
  to debug the tutorials and assignments. However, you may wish to add
  or remove your own commands to <a href="gdb.ini" target="gdb">gdb.ini</a>, to reflect the way you solve your
  assignments.</p>
<P>Launch  the debugger with the command <span class="userTyped">gdb t2</span>.
  Set a breakpoint at <span class="sourcecode">exponent</span>, run the program,
  and enter values of 5 and 0 for X and N. Before the the <span class="sourcecode">cmp</span> instruction
  is executed,
  <span class="register">cpsr</span> has values inherited from essentially random
  activity; after the comparison, however,  <span class="register">cpsr</span> becomes:</P>
<pre>
1: /x $cpsr = 0x60000010</pre>
<P>Notice that the first hexadecimal digit of <span class="register">cpsr</span> is 6. Looking
  up this value in Figure 3.1  of the text, we find that the condition
bits produced by this comparing zero (in <span class="register">r1</span>) with zero (immediate) are:</P>
<table border="0" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" align="center">
  <tr align="center"> 
    <td> 0</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>0</td>
  </tr>
  <tr align="center"> 
    <td>N</td>
    <td>Z</td>
    <td>C</td>
    <td>V</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<P>The Z bit makes sense--but why is the Carry set? Save this question for another 
  chapter!</P>
<P>As you step further through the program, you find that the program loads 1 
  into
<span class="register">r2</span>, ignores the instruction loading 0 into
<span class="register">r2</span>, and branches to the return 
  label, which puts the 1 into
<span class="register">r0</span>. Continuing from the return statement, we find 
  that 1 is indeed returned as the result of 5^0.</P>
<P>Let the program run, but this time enter 5 and -1. Which the condition bits 
  are set this time? Note that the processor visits exactly the same instructions 
  as before, only this time the program really does load 0 into
<span class="register">r2</span>.</P>
<P>Now that you have traced the behaviour of simple decision sequences, loops 
  will not seem much more difficult. Enter an X and N of "2 3", and step through 
  the function. You will see the following points of interest:</P>
<div class="hangingindent"> 
  <p>19: Note that the CPSR = 0x20000010. Since the N and Z bits are both zero,
    the <span class="sourcecode">ble</span> instruction
     is ignored, and we proceed into the main loop.</p>
  <p>22: The <span class="sourcecode">subs</span> 
  instruction subtracts one from
<span class="register">r1</span>, storing a <span class="sourcecode">2</span> 
    there, and setting the CPSR to 0x20000010. Since the result of the subtraction
      is a positive integer, the <span class="sourcecode">N</span> 
    and <span class="sourcecode">Z</span> bits are both clear.</p>
  <p>23: We multiply 1 by 2, putting 2 into
<span class="register">r2</span>. <span class="register">cpsr</span> does not change.</p>
  <p>24: Since N and Z are clear, we take the branch, meaning that the next instruction
     is... </p>
  <p>22: Again, we subtract 1 from
<span class="register">r1</span>, leaving 1 there. What are
    the condition bits?</p>
  <p>23: We multiply 2 by 2, putting 4 into
<span class="register">r2</span>.</p>
  <p>...</p>
</div>
<P>Keep stepping, and you should be able to predict when the backward branch is 
  finally ignored. Once you are sure you know how the program works, you are ready 
  to write your own.</P>
<P><b>Self Tests</b></P>
<ol>
  <li>(4) List each statement executed, and each general register changed,
    when the following values of X and N are entered:&#9; </li>
  <table width="75%" border="0" align="center">
    <tr> 
      <td>a. 5 2</td>
      <td> 
        <p>b. 5 -2</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <li>(2) Suppose the CPSR reads 0x40000010, and the pending instruction is &quot;blt
     label&quot;. Will the branch be taken? Explain why or why not. 
  </li>
</ol>
<P><b>Assignments</b></P>
<P>Name your files <B>t2s</B><I>x</I><B>.s</B> and <B>t2s</B><I>x</I><B>m.cpp</B>, 
  replacing the <I>x</I> with the letter of your individual assignment. In each 
  case, the .s file will contain a function in assembly, while the .cpp file will 
  contain a main program that takes arguments and prints a result.</P>
