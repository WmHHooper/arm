<P>The ARM specification provides sixteen double-precision floating point registers
  <span class="register">d0..d15</span>. 
  Each register holds a 64-bit operand in the IEEE 754 double-precision
  format. Floating-point instructions typically use with the same opcodes as
  their integer counterparts, prefixed by the letter <span class="sourcecode">f</span> and
  suffixed by the letter <span class="sourcecode">d</span> to indicate
  double- or single-precision operands. Thus, for example, 
  <span class="sourcecode">faddd d1, d2, d3</span> adds 
  <span class="register">d3</span> to 
  <span class="register">d2</span>,
  storing the result in 
  <span class="register">d1</span>. No
  floating point registers are reserved by the runtime system, so your function
  is free to use all sixteen of them as needed.</P>
<P>Single-precision conventions are similar, with some quirks. There are thirty-two
  single-precision registers, <span class="register">s0..s31</span>, 
  but they overlap their double-precision
  counterparts as shown in the figure at right. Thus, storing a value in register
  <span class="register">d0</span> overwrites both 
  <span class="register">s0</span> and 
  <span class="register">s1</span>, while storage in 
  <span class="register">s2</span> overwrites half of 
  <span class="register">d1</span>. As
  the documentation notes: &quot;No damage is caused but the results are meaningless.&quot;
  The mnemonics are suffixed with an <span class="sourcecode">s</span> 
  <span class="sourcecode">fsubs s1, s2, s3</span> subtracts 
  <span class="register">s3</span> from 
  <span class="register">s2</span>,
  storing the result in 
  <span class="register">s1</span>. (Notice that the
  <span class="sourcecode">s</span>suffix, used to set condition
  codes for integer operations, is not allowed in floating point mnemonics, whether
  single- or double-precision. To set a condition code based on  floating
  point registers, use 
  <span class="sourcecode">fcmp</span>.)  </P>
<P>Functions read double-precision arguments from 
  <span class="register">d0</span>, 
  <span class="register">d1</span>,
  ..., etc., and return double-precision values in 
  <span class="register">d0</span>. Likewise,
  they read single-precision arguments from 
  <span class="register">s0</span>, <span class="register">s1</span>,
  ..., etc., and return single-precision values in 
  <span class="register">d0</span>.
  Functions with mixed arguments--integer, single- and double-precision--read the
  integers from 
  <span class="register">r0</span>, 
  <span class="register">r1</span>, ..., and fit the floating point arguments into the first
  registers available. Thus, for example, 
  <span class="sourcecode">float f(int a, double b, float c)</span> would find 
  <span class="sourcecode">a</span> in 
  <span class="register">r0</span>, 
  <span class="sourcecode">b</span> in 
  <span class="register">d0</span>,
  <span class="sourcecode">c</span> in 
  <span class="register">s2</span>, and return its value in 
  <span class="register">s0</span> (overwriting half of
  <span class="sourcecode">b</span>).</P>
<P>The best documentation for floating point intructions, as used by GCC
  and GDB, is in the 
   <a href="../intro.html#ref" target="intro">ARM Developer Suite Assembler Guide</a>.
  Newer instructions exist than the ones documented there, 
  but instructions in this Guide match those used by the compiler.</P>
<P>This program is shown in two versions: 
  <a href="t9v0.c" target="t9v0">t9v0.c</a> and 
  <a href="t9v1.s" target="t9v1">t9v1.s</a>.
  both programs link with 
  <a href="t9m.cpp" target="t9m">t9m.cpp</a>, and
  both perform the same arithmetic. In a later tutorial, we are going to write
  more sophisticated versions of the function, and run each version on the same
  large data set so that we can compare performance. Let's begin with 
  <a href="t9v0.c" target="source">t9v0.c</a>:</P>
<div class="hangingindent"> 
  <P>8: The dot product of two vectors, X &bull; Y, is computed by multiplying
    each pair of elements together and summing the result. Thus, { 1, 2, 3 } &bull; {
    4, 5, 6 } = 1*4 + 2*5 + 4*6 = 4 + 10 + 24 = 38.</P>
  <P>11: As typical, we represent a vector X of length N by an array beginning
    at <span class="sourcecode">X[0]</span> and ending at <span class="sourcecode">X[N-1]</span>.</P>
  <P>9, 12, 14: Again typically, we initialize  the local variable <span class="sourcecode">sum</span> to zero,
     use it to keep a running total as we progress through the loop, and return
    its value when the loop completes.</P>
</div>
<P>With 
  <a href="t9v0.c" target="t9v0">t9v0.c</a> as a guide, we can read the assembly in 
  <a href="t9v1.s" target="t9v1">t9v1.s</a> more easily:</P>
<P class="hangingindent">16: We use 
  <span class="register">d0</span> to hold 
  <span class="sourcecode">sum</span>,
  since that's the value we  return.</P>
<P class="hangingindent">17: This line is commented out because it does not always
  work. It would safe and efficient to clear an integer register value with 
  <span class="sourcecode">sub r0, r1, r1</span>,
  but the same is not true of floating point registers. If a register 
  <span class="register">d1</span> contains
  <span class="sourcecode">INF</span> or <span class="sourcecode">NaN</span>, then 
  <span class="sourcecode">d1 - d1 = NaN</span>. The best practice  is to initialize
  floating point registers from memory.</P>
<P class="hangingindent">20-23, 26-27: Pointers are always stored in integer
  registers, no matter the data to which they point. Double-precision operands
  are 8 bytes, hence the need to advance the pointers by 8 each iteration. Post-indexed
  addressing would be helpful here, but ARM does not support this mode for floating
  point
  memory operations.</P>
<P class="hangingindent">24-25: <span class="sourcecode">fmuld</span> and <span class="sourcecode">faddd</span> are very similar to their integer
  counterparts, in syntax and execution.</P>
<P>A few notes about <a href="gdb.ini" target="gdb">gdb.ini</a> are also appropriate here:</P>
<P class="hangingindent">5-6: Since 
  <span class="register">r0</span> and 
  <span class="register">r1</span> point to vectors, these commands
  display the first four elements of each vector. The
  <span class="sourcecode">/_fg</span> suffix
  designates 
  <span class="sourcecode"><u>f</u></span>loating
  point display of 
  <span class="sourcecode"><u>g</u></span>iant
  (8 byte) operands; the format for single-precision would be 
  <span class="sourcecode">/_fx</span>.</P>
<P class="hangingindent">7-11: When referring directly to registers, 
  <span class="sourcecode">/f</span> is
  sufficient to display their floating-point values.  The command 
  <span class="sourcecode">display/s $s0</span> 
  would display the value of the single-precision register.</P>
<P>The main program in 
  <a href="t9m.cpp" target="t9m">t9m.cpp</a> has a lot
  of bells and whistles, associated with reading
  vector input and identifying multiple versions.  Here are a few things to notice:</P>
<P class="hangingindent">20, 25, 41, 46-56: Since we're going to compare multiple versions of the same
  function, it's nice to be reminded which version is running. When a C/++ program
  executes,
  <span class="sourcecode">argv[]</span> is an array of strings, the first of
  which is the path to the program. So, for example, when a user invokes 
  <span class="userTyped">./t9v0</span>, 
  <span class="sourcecode">argv[0]</span> may
  equal 
  <span class="sourcecode">/home/<script>writeUserName()</script>/tutorials/t9/t9v0</span>.
  The baseName function extracts <span class="sourcecode">t9v0</span> from the path name.</P>
<P class="hangingindent">21, 29, 58-74: The <span class="sourcecode">readVectors()</span> function
  prompts for the length of the vectors, then for each element of each vector. The
   I/O was moved here to keep the main program simple. The arguments <span class="sourcecode">&amp;X</span>, <span class="sourcecode">&amp;Y</span>,
  and <span class="sourcecode">&amp;N</span> are passed by reference, so that
  their values can be set within the function. (For compatibility with later
  versions, the size allocated to each vector is actually rounded up to the nearest
  multiple of 4, and zeroes fill the extra slots.)</P>
<P class="hangingindent">22, 59, 76-82: We need long vectors to test performance, but typing in more
  than a few values is extremely tedious. This program is designed to read input
  redirected from a file as well as the terminal. The getPrompt() function figures
  out where
  the input is coming from; and assigns prompts accordingly. If input is the
  terminal, prompts are displayed as usual, but if input is a file,
  the prompts disappear into <span class="sourcecode">/dev/null</span>, colloqually
  known as the <span class="sourcecode">bitbucket</span>.</P>
<P class="hangingindent">29-37: Aside from all the I/O, this program is very
  simple! To time the function accurately, we call <span class="sourcecode">clock_gettime()</span> before
  and after the method as we did in 
  <script>writeNamedTutorial('fib1')</script>.</P>
<P>Make and run <span class="sourcecode">t9v0</span>, and try it with two short
  vectors. Do the same with <span class="sourcecode">t9v1</span>, and verify
  that it computes the same dot product for the same pair of vectors. (Because
  this program exists
  in multiple versions, you cannot simply make or run <span class="sourcecode">t9</span>;
  the correct commands are <span class="userTyped">make t9v0 &amp;&amp; ./t9v0
  &amp;&amp; make t9v1 &amp;&amp; ./t9v1</span>.)</P>
<P>Debug <span class="sourcecode">t9v1</span>, set the breakpoint in <span class="sourcecode">dotProd</span>,
  and supply the same input. As you step through the instructions, you should
  see the floating-point values copied from memory into 
  <span class="register">d2</span> and 
  <span class="register">d3</span>, 
  their products computed in 
  <span class="register">d4</span>, 
  and the sum accumulate in 
  <span class="register">d0</span>.</P>
