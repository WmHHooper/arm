<h1>t8: Exceptions 1</h1>
<script>wNavbar()</script>
<P>In this tutorial we will explore the exception handling capabilities provided
  by the Linux operating system that runs on the 
  <script>writeLongMachineName()</script>
  . To experiment with the low-level
  exception handling described in the text, you would need to debug the Linux
  ARM kernel, or use a  simpler operating system. </P>
<P>The Linux operating system has a relatively transparent mechanism for some
  exceptions. In this example, the program will try to read memory that was not
  allocated to it. As the text explains, this generates a &quot;Data Abort&quot; in the
  ARM Processor. We cannot process this abort directly, but the Linux operating
  system on the
  <script>writeLongMachineName()</script>
  will, if we allow, catch this exception and call the function
  we designate, just as though a procedure call had occurred in the  executing
  program. As we will see,
  this facility gives us a great deal of flexibility in handling the exception.</P>
<P>First, let's examine the program. This main program initializes  an array,
  and na√Øvely allows us to examine values by entering an index. By failing to
  check that the input is within the array bounds, the program allows us to trigger
  memory exceptions. Here are a few notes on 
  <a href="t8m.cpp" target="t8m">t8m.cpp</a>:</P>
<P class="hangingindent">16: A Linux signal handler must be void, and must take
  one argument, the value of the signal.</P>
<P class="hangingindent">17: An array initialized with some prime numbers,
  an arbitrary choice, so we have some memory to display.</P>
<P class="hangingindent">18-19: These variables are shared by the main program
  and the exception handler, as we'll see in 
  <a href="t8.s" target="t8">t8.s</a>.</P>
<P class="hangingindent">24-29: These instructions set up the program to call
  the handler when the exception occurs. the name 
  <span class="sourcecode">sigaction</span>
  denotes both a structure and a function; both are described in the 
  <a href="../intro.html#ref" target="intro">Local man pages</a>. 
  The particular exception chosen, in this case SIGSEGV,
  is the one most often triggered
  by an out-of-bounds array assignment. Other choices made here are:></P>
<ul class="hungindent">
  <li>Not to mask other exceptions while the handler runs.</li>
  <li>Not to invoke any special behaviors.</li>
</ul>
<P>The handler is not complex, but some of its activity is a bit subtle. Here
  are a few notes on 
  <a href="t8.s" target="t8">t8.s</a>:</P>
<P class="hangingindent">31: The linker replaces the symbol <span class="sourcecode">last_signal</span>
  with the address of this variable
  in main().</P>
<P class="hangingindent">14-15: When  <span class="sourcecode">bouncer()</span> executes, <span class="register">r0</span> contains the
  signal number. In this program, we expect that value to be SIGSEGV because
  that's the only signal we are set up to handle, but in general this parameter
  is useful to determine the exception we are handling. 
  To copy this value where the main program can read it, we first load the address
  of <span class="sourcecode">last_signal</span> into
  <span class="register">r1</span>, then we use 
  <span class="sourcecode">[r1]</span> as
  a pointer to store <span class="register">r0</span>.</P>
<P class="hangingindent">17-19: Since <span class="sourcecode">last_signal</span> and <span class="sourcecode">count</span> are
  declared contiguously in memory, [r1, #4] points to count. We use that address
  to load the count, increment it, and store the new value. WARNING: this code
  is brittle, and will break if the declarations in
  <a href="t8m.cpp" target="t8m">t8m.cpp</a> are moved!</P>
<P class="hangingindent">21-23: As is stated in the text, the exception hardware
  for a data abort pushes the address of the instruction that caused the exception
  onto the stack, so that the exception can be retried after the handler executes.
  In our case, that would cause an infinite loop: because each time the handler
  returned, the program would ty to fetch the same, non-existent array value.
  The solution here is to fetch the 
  <span class="register">pc</span> from the program stack, increment it to
  point to the next instruction, and save it back. The program will &quot;return&quot; from
  the interrupt to the next instruction, and proceed to print the new value...</P>
<P class="hangingindent">25-26: ...except that, in place of the non-existent
  array value, we wish A[i] to return -1.  Linux has helped us out by
  saving the register values on the stack along with the 
  <span class="register">pc</span>. By writing new values
  onto the stack, we can change the registers when the program resumes.</P>
<p>Make and run this program, and verify that <span class="sourcecode">A[2]=5</span>, <span class="sourcecode">A[7]=23</span>,
  etc. Then, try large, invalid indices; A[2000], for example, should report
  -1, thanks to the signal handler. The program should be able to handle a mix
  of valid and invalid indices, reporting correct values for indices in the array,
  random values for indices slightly out of bounds, and -1 for indices that cause
  segment faults. If you're not sure what all the signal-handling
  fuss is about, comment out line 30 in t8m.cpp, re-make the program and try
  fetching A[2000] without the handler in place.</p>
<p>Use gdb to trace the operation of the program. Set a break point at bouncer,
  run the program, and enter <span class="userTyped">2</span> as
  the first index. the program should
  report
  <span class="sourcecode">A[2]=5</span> without stopping at the handler. Enter
  <span class="userTyped">2000</span>, however, and the program will
  respond similar to this:</p>
<pre>
Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0x00008a48 in main () at t8m.cpp:38
38        v = A[i];
0xbefffa88: <span class="ignore">0x00008970</span> ...
...
(gdb) </pre>
<p>In this case, GDB has caught the exception before our handler.  Enter <span class="userTyped">si</span>,
and we find ourselves in the exception handler:</p>
<pre>
Breakpoint 1, 0x00008970 in bouncer ()

(gdb)</pre>
<p>Not only has control moved from main() to bouncer(); the stack has jumped
  188 words, from <span class="sourcecode">0x...a88</span> to <span class="sourcecode">0x...798</span>.
  Among the many, many things pushed onto the stack are the values of all 16
  registers, <span class="register">r0..r15</span>,
  at addresses <span class="sourcecode">0xbefff7b8..f4</span>. When execution
  returns from bounce(), these values will all be popped off the stack and stored
  into the registers, to restore the processor to its precise state at the point
  the exception occurred. </p>
<p>We can use the values on the stack to figure out exactly which instruction
  created the exception, and the values of its operands. From the stack dump,
  as from the earlier segment fault, we see that the program counter was at location <span class="sourcecode">0x00008a48</span> when
  the fault occurred. We can see the faulting instructions by disassembling the
  program around the return address:</p>
<pre>
(gdb) <span class="userTyped">disass 0x8a44,0x8a50</span>
Dump of assembler code from 0x8a44 to 0x8a50:
   0x00008a44 &lt;main()+164&gt;: ldr r3, [pc, #376]<br>   0x00008a48 &lt;main()+168>: ldr r3, [r3, r2, lsl #2]
   0x00008a4c &lt;main()+172>: str r3, [r11, #-16]
End of assembler dump.
(gdb) </pre>
<p>From these instructions it appears the <span class="register">r3</span> contains the pointer to A[], and
  <span class="register">r2</span> contains the index. Indeed, we see that 
  <span class="sourcecode">r2=0x7d0=2000</span>,
  value of the index. We also see that the instruction failed when
  it tried to load a new value into <span class="register">r3</span>, and that
  the effective address <span class="sourcecode">[r3, r2, lsl #2]</span> is equivalent
  to <span class="sourcecode">A[i]</span>. (The <span class="sourcecode">lsl
  #2</span> operation multiplies the
  index by 4, because each integer takes 4 memory locations.)</p>
<p>Step through the next 5 instructions (lines 7-11 of 
  <a href="t8.s" target="t8">t8.s</a>), which update the
  global variables <span class="sourcecode">last_signal</span> and <span class="sourcecode">count</span>.
  The method used here is similar to
  that used in previous tutorials, except for the pointer arithmetic used to
  access <span class="sourcecode">count</span>.</p>
<p>The next 3 instructions are more subtle. We
  see that the program counter has been saved on the stack at location <span class="sourcecode">0xbefff74</span>. We
  want
  to move this pointer
  past the instruction that raised the exception, to prevent it from raising
  this exception all over again. The <span class="sourcecode">ldr</span> instruction
  copies the pointer, <span class="sourcecode">0x8a48</span>,
  into <span class="register">r3</span>; the <span class="sourcecode">add</span> increments
  it to <span class="sourcecode">0x8a4c</span>;
  and the <span class="sourcecode">str</span> saves it back on the
  stack. When
  the handler completes, the program counter is restored from the stack,
  but execution will resume one instruction later.</p>
<p>Similarly, the next two instructions change the result of <span class="sourcecode">A[i]</span>. The
  destination of the
  <span class="sourcecode">ldr</span> instruction at 
  <span class="sourcecode">0x8a48</span>  is 
  <span class="register">r3</span>,
  which is saved on the stack at location <span class="sourcecode">0xbefff7c4</span>. By
  storing
  <span class="sourcecode">-1</span> in this location, the handler changes the
  value returned by the reference to <span class="sourcecode">A[i]</span>. If
  we continue at the <span class="sourcecode">mov pc, lr</span> instruction,
  the program reports that &quot;<span class="sourcecode">A[2000]
  = -1</span>&quot;, none the wiser for the handler's manipulations.</p>
<p><b>Assignments</b></p>
<ol class="assignment">
  <li> Write a main program with an apparently infinite loop, and a handler for
    SIGINT. Linux sends SIGINT whenever an impatient user types CTRL-C. The
    handler must  change the loop condition, and the main program must exit the
    loop and print a message to indicate that the signal was received.
    Run the program and type CTRL-C to ensure that your program exits cleanly.</li>
  <li> Write a main program with an apparently infinite loop, and a handler for
    SIGQUIT. Linux sends SIGQUIT whenever an impatient user types CTRL-\. The
    handler must change the loop condition, and the main program must exit the
    loop and print a message to indicate that the signal was received. Run the
    program and type CTRL-\ to ensure that your program exits cleanly.</li>
  <li>Write a main program with an apparently infinite loop, and a handler for
    SIGALRM. The main program will set up the handler and use the alarm() system
    call to schedule a (~5 second) alarm before it enters the loop. Use your
    handler to change the loop condition, and include a message in the main program
    to indicate that the loop exits normally. Run the program and wait for the
    timer to expire, to ensure that your program exits cleanly.</li>
  <li> Write a main program with an apparently infinite loop, and a handler for
    SIGTERM. The
    handler must change the loop condition, and the main program must exit the
  loop and print a message to indicate that the signal was received. Test your
  handler by opening a second terminal window and typing the command:
  <pre>
... t8]$ killall t8sd
... t8]$</pre>
When you switch back to the first terminal window, the message should be printed.
