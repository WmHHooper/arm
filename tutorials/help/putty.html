<h1>Connecting to the 
  <script>writeLongMachineName()</script>
with PuTTY</h1>
<script>wNavbar()</script>
<ol>
  <li>Download and install PuTTY from:<br />
  <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html" target="download">http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html</a> </li>
  <li>Logging in:
    <ol>
      <li>Launch PuTTY. After the first-time user dialog, you should reach
        the host
        selection window below:<br />
        <img src="images/putty.png" width="456" height="442" alt="putty" />  </li>
      <li>Enter <strong>csc.belmont.edu</strong> as the Host Name, and be sure to select the <strong>SSH</strong> Protocol. Click
        the <strong>Open</strong> button.  the first time you do this, you will be prompted to
        accept the key from the CSC Server. Click <strong>Yes</strong>, and you should see a new
        screen like the following:<br />
        <img src="images/putty-terminal1.png" width="523" height="70" alt="term" />  </li>
      <li>Respond to the login as: prompt with the UserName you were handed in
        class. Respond
        to the password prompt with your password. Notice that the password characters
        are <em>not</em> echoed on the screen. When you login correctly, you
        will see a last login message and a prompt &quot;[<em>userid</em>@hl36
        ~]$ &quot; as
        shown below:<br />
      <img src="images/putty-terminal2.png" width="523" height="113" alt="term" />      </li>
      <li>At this point, you are logged into the CSC Server, <span class="sourcecode">hl36</span>,
        but you
        have not yet reached the 
        <script>writeLongMachineName()</script>
        . Enter the command: <span class="userTyped">ssh <script language="">wDNS()</script></span>
        to complete your login. You prompt should change to 
        <span class="sourcecode">[<em>userid</em>@<script language="">wDNS()</script> ~]$ </span> 
        as shown below:<br />
        <img src="images/putty-terminal3.png" width="523" height="141" alt="term" /></li>
      <li> At this point you are logged in and ready to begin the
        lesson. As you work through the lessons, always be sure you are logged
        into the 
        <script>writeLongMachineName()</script>
by checking for the <strong>
        <script language="">
wMAbr()
        
        </script>
        </strong>        prompt.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Logging out:
    <ol>
      <li>Since you are logged into two machines, you have to log out of both
        machines in reverse order. To log out of the 
        <script>writeLongMachineName()</script>, enter
        the <span class="userTyped">exit</span> command at the
        <strong>
        <script language="">
wMAbr()
        
        </script>
        </strong>        prompt. Unlike the picture below,
        the screen actually clears before you see the 
        <span class="sourcecode">Connection ... closed.</span>
        message and the <strong>hl36</strong> prompt.<br />
      <img src="images/putty-logout.png" width="283" height="111" alt="logout" />      </li>
      <li>Enter <span class="userTyped">exit</span> at the hl36 prompt. This will close your PuTTY
        window and exit the application. To reconnect, launch PuTTY and begin
        at step 2.1</li>
      <li>If you leave your computer while the PuTTY window is open, it will
        eventually disconnect from the server on its own. When you return, the
        window title will include the word &quot;(inactive)&quot;, and the terminal
        will not respond to anything you type. To resume, click the PuTTY icon <img src="images/putty-icon.jpg" alt="icon" width="18" height="18" align="top" /> and
        choose &quot;Restart Session&quot; from the pop-up menu. You will then
        need to resume at step 2.2 .</li>
