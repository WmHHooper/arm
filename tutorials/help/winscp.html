<h1>Editing remote files with WinSCP</h1>
<script>wNavbar()</script>
<ol>
  <li>Download and install WinSCP from:<br />
  <a href="http://winscp.net/eng/download.php" target="download">http://winscp.net/eng/download.php</a> </li>
  <li>Connect to the CSC File Server:
    <ol>
      <li>Launch WinSCP. After the first-time user dialog, you should reach the
        host selection window below:<br />
      <img src="images/winscp.png" width="538" height="346" alt="winscp" />        </li>
      <li>Enter <strong>csc.belmont.edu</strong> as the Host Name, and be sure
        to select the <strong>SFTP</strong> Protocol. WinSCP should select Port
        number 22 automatically when you select <strong>SFTP</strong>. Enter
        your User name and password, then click the <strong>Login</strong> button.
        The first time you do this, you will be prompted to accept the host key
        from the CSC Server. Click <strong>Yes</strong>, and you should see a
      new screen like the following:<br />
      <img src="images/winscp-home.png" width="445" height="327" alt="home" /></li>
      <li>Double-click the private folder. The address will change to 
      <span class="sourcecode">/home/csc/<em>username</em>/private/</span>
        window will change to show the contents of your public folder.</li>
      <li>Double-click the csc2110 folder. Note the change in address and view.</li>
      <li>Double-click the tutorials folder. Note the change in address and view.</li>
      <li>Double-click the  folder for your current tutorial. The address should read <span class="sourcecode">/home/csc/<em>username</em>/private/csc2110/tutorials/t<em>N</em>/</span>,
        where N is the letter of your tutorial, and the folder window should
        display the files for your tutorial. The folder for Tutorial 0 is shown
        below as an example.</li>
      <img src="images/winscp-t0.png" width="467" height="262" alt="t0" />
</ol>
  </li>
  <li>Edit files:
    <ol>
      <li>To edit a file, for example t0m.cpp, right-click the file and choose
        Edit from the pop-up menu. An editor window appears like the one
        below:<br />
        <img src="images/winscp-edit.png" width="526" height="208" alt="edit" /></li>
      <li>Note the line number at the bottom left corner of the window. As
        you debug files, line numbers will guid you to checkpoints and errors.</li>
      <li>The disk icon <img src="images/winscp-disk-icon.jpg" alt="disk" width="18" height="17" align="top" />,
        second from left in the toolbar, is gray when the file you are editing
        is in sync with the copy on the Playstation 3, but turns bold when
        you make changes that have not yet been saved. Normally, you will
        want to save early and often!</li>
      <li>You can open as many edit windows as you need to do the tutorial,
        and leave them open as long as you need. Close the edit windows when
        you are done; you will be prompted to save any final changes.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Disconnect
      <ol>
        <li>When you close the main WinSCP window, you will be reminded that
          you are disconnecting from the server. Click &quot;Yes&quot;, and
          your connection will be closed. Return to Step 2.1 to resume editing.</li>
        <li>If you leave your computer while the WinSCP window is open, it
          will eventually disconnect from the server on its own. When you return,
          you will be prompted to restore the connection; however, you will
          have to wait for the connection to be re-established, and you may
          have to return to Step 2.1 in order to complete the connection.</li>
      </ol>
