<h1>Connecting to the 
  <script>writeLongMachineName()</script>
with Terminal</h1>
<script>wNavbar()</script>
<ol>
  <li>You will find the Terminal application in the Utilities folder on your
    Mac, or you can type <span class="userTyped">terminal</span> in the Spotlight search box. Terminal
    will launch and present a window like the one below. In the figure, commands
  you type are highlighted in red.</li>
  <li>Logging in:
<ol>
      <li>The ssh program is also installed with your Mac, and is accessible
        from the command line. Enter the command <span class="userTyped">ssh <em>username</em>@csc.belmont.edu</span>
        at the local prompt to connect your machine to the CSC Server. The first
        time you connect, you will be prompted with the server's public key.
        Answer <span class="userTyped">yes</span> to store the key and continue your session. You will then
        be prompted for the password; notice that the password characters
        are <em>not</em> echoed on the screen. When you login correctly, you
        will see a last login message and a prompt &quot;[<em>username</em>@hl36
        ~]$ &quot; as shown in the figure.<br />
        <img src="images/terminal.png" alt="" name="terminal" width="495" height="199" id="terminal" /></li>
      <li>At this point, you are logged into the CSC Server, <strong>hl36</strong>,
        but you have not yet reached the 
        <script>writeLongMachineName()</script>. Enter the command: &quot;ssh
        ps3&quot;
        to complete your login. You prompt should change to &quot;[<em>username</em>@ps3
        ~]$ &quot; as shown in the figure.</li>
</ol>
  </li>
  <li>Logging out:
    <ol>
      <li>You are logged into three machines, so you have to log out of two of
        them,  in reverse order, to get back to your local machine. To log out
        of the 
        <script>writeLongMachineName()</script>, enter the <span class="userTyped">exit</span> command
        at the <strong>ps3</strong> prompt. Unlike the picture below, the screen
        actually clears before you see the <span class="sourcecode">Connection ... closed.</span>
        message and the <strong>hl36</strong> prompt.<br />
        <img src="images/terminal-logout.png" width="376" height="152" alt="logout" /></li>
      <li>Enter <span class="userTyped">exit</span> at the <span class="sourcecode">hl36</span> prompt. You will
        be back at the <strong>local</strong> prompt.</li>
      <li>You may leave Terminal running, and  begin at step 2.1 the next time
        you need to connect to the <script>writeLongMachineName()</script>. 
        Or, you may quit Terminal,
        in which case you'll have to start at step 1 to reconnect.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>In summary:
    <ol>
      <li>It is important to notice the three distinct prompts in the
        Terminal window. Befor you connnect to another machine, the prompt  
        <span class="sourcecode">[<em>localname</em>@<em>local-machine</em> ~]$ </span>
        reflects the User Name and machine name you chose for your own Macintosh.
        The prompt changes to 
        <span class="sourcecode">[<em>username</em>@hl36 ~]$ </span> when you
        connect to the CSC server, and again to 
        <span class="sourcecode">[<em>username</em>@
        <script>wMPrompt()</script> ~]$ </span> when you connect to the 
        <script>writeLongMachineName()</script>. Make it a habit to
        know, at all times, who you are and where you are logged in!</li>
