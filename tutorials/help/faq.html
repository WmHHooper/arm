<h1>Frequently Answered Questions </h1>

  <li class="question">Do I have to do these tutorials?
  <p class="answer">The tutorials cover several of your weekly homework assignments,
     about 1/3 of your total homework grade. Check the <a href="https://csc.belmont.edu/hooper/csc2110/policies.html" target="policies">syllabus</a>,
  and do the math.</p></li>
  <li class="question">'make' is giving me a bunch of errors:<pre>
[<script>writeUserName()</script>@myMac t1]$ <span class="userTyped">make t1</span>
gcc -c t1.s
t1.s:1:Junk character 64 (@).
t1.s:1:Rest of line ignored. 1st junk character valued 32 ( ).
...</pre>
How do I fix it?
  <p class="answer">The key to the problem is  in your prompt. The <span class="sourcecode">@myMac</span> means
    you are working with a copy of the tutorials on your machine, rather than
    the on the
    <script>writeLongMachineName()</script>
    . Copy any edits to your 
    <script>wMAbr()</script>
account, and login to the
<script>writeLongMachineName()</script>
. Similarly, errors like this:</p>
  <pre>
[<script>writeUserName()</script>@hl36 t1]$ <span class="userTyped">make t1</span>
gcc -c t1.s
t1.s: Assembler messages:
t1.s:1: Error: junk at end of line, first unrecognized character is `@'
...</pre>
  <p class="answer">mean that you are trying ot compile on the login server,
    <span class="sourcecode">hl36</span>, and you should login to the 
    <script>writeLongMachineName()</script>
    . An
    error message like this:</p></li>
    <pre>
[<script>writeUserName();documant.write('@');wMPrompt()</script> ~]$ <span class="userTyped">make t1</span>
make: *** No rule to make target `t1'. Stop.</pre>
  
<p class="answer">means that your current directory, ~, is incorrect, and you
  should change to the <span class="sourcecode">t1</span> directory. Before you
  make, check your prompt: are you are logged in 
  
  <script>document.write('<span class="sourcecode">@');wMPrompt();document.write('</span>,')</script>
   
  in the correct directory?</p>
<li class="question">I keep changing the program, but it runs exactly the same
  way. What gives?
  <p class="answer"> Be sure that the copy you are editing is the copy you
    are compiling. You can check from the command line by typing, for example:</p>
  <pre>
[<script>writeUserName();documant.write('@');wMPrompt()</script> t1]$ <span class="userTyped">cat t1.s</span>
@ CSC 2110, Computer Organization
@ Tutorial 1: Introduction to Assembly
...
  .ident  "Aamy Aardvark"
[<script>writeUserName();documant.write('@');wMPrompt()</script> t1]$ </pre>
  <p class="answer">If the file you see on the command line is different 
    from the one you've been editing, you're working on the wrong copy.</p>
</li>
  <li class="question">GDB doesn't recognize my breakpoints. Here's a transcript:
    <pre>
[<script>writeUserName();documant.write('@');wMPrompt()</script> t1]$ <span class="userTyped">gdb t1</span>
...
t1: No such file or directory.
...
(gdb) <span class="userTyped">br ftoc</span>
No symbol table is loaded.  Use the &quot;file&quot; command.
Make breakpoint pending on future shared library load? (y or [n]) 
(gdb) </pre>
    <p class="answer">Your last compilation failed, so there is no executable
      file  to debug. Quit GDB, scroll your terminal window back to the last
      compilation, find out what the error was, correct the code, re-compile,
      and resume debugging. </p>
<p class="answer">This
      error is less insidious that it could be; if your compilation fails, but there
      is an executable file left over from a previous effort, it may take you
      many steps of debugging before you realize you're debugging the wrong file! Before
    you debug, check that the last compilation succeeded.</p>
