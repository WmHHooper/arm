<h1>Bash Quick Reference</h1>
<script>wNavbar()</script>

<p>When you open a terminal window, you are actually running a program called
  Bash. Bash is an example of a command-line shell, a program that reads what
  you type and runs the corresponding programs. Usually your typing is read a
  line at a time; the first word on the line is treated as a <i>command</i>,
  while the words that follow are <i>arguments</i>. 
  Even on a small system like the 
  <script>writeLongMachineName()</script>, 
  there are hundreds of bash commands, 
  and each command has its own rules for processing arguments. Moreover, each 
  program you write this semester will add a new command to your own, local dialect.</p>
<p>Below is a list of the bash commands used in these tutorials. The commands
   are listed in the order they appear in the tutorials. Each is command listed
   with typical arguments in italics, followed by a brief explanation of what
  it  does. In many cases, there are links to further information. A complete
  reference to the Bash language is found in the <a href="../intro.html#bash" target="intro">Bash Reference Manual</a> online.</p>
<p><b><a name="cd"></a>cd</b> <i>folder</i></p>
<p>changes the current directory to <i>folder</i>. The current directory is the 
  equivalent to the open folder in a Windows Explorer or Macintosh Finder window. 
  Files in the current directory are easy to find and manipulate, so you almost 
  always begin a tutorial by changing to the proper directory. Note that you can 
  tell each change is successful, because bash changes its prompt to reflect the 
  current directory. Typing <b>cd</b> with no argument takes you to the home folder, 
  /home/csc/<i>user</i>. Typing 
  <span class="userTyped">cd ..</span> takes you to the enclosing folder (e.g.,
  from t0 back to tutorials). </p>
<p><b><a name="pwd"></a>pwd</b></p>
<p>prints the complete pathname of the current directory. If you mistype a <a href="#cd">cd</a> 
  command and get lost, pwd will help you find the way back. </p>
<p> <b><a name="ls"></a>ls</b></p>
<p>lists all the non-hidden files in the current directory. This command has many 
  options, but the simple version is adequate for these tutorials. A list of typical 
  files follows: the names in <b>bold</b> are the ones you should be sure to locate 
  before you begin, while names in italics are of less essential files:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>t0m.cpp</b> - source code for a conventional C++ program.</li>
  <li><b>t0.cpp </b><i>or</i><b> </b><b>t0.c </b><i>or</i><b> t0.s</b> - source 
    code for a function written in C++, C or assembly.</li>
  <li><b>makefile</b> - contains the rules for turning the C++ and assembly files 
    into a running program.</li>
  <li><b>gdb.ini</b> - contains the settings to debug the current program.</li>
  <li><i>t0m.o, t0.o</i> - object files compiled from the source code.</li>
  <li><i>t0</i> - the executable program</li>
  <li><strong>t1v1.s</strong>, <em>t1v1.o</em>, <em>t1v1</em> - some programs
    exist in multiple versions, to follow successive stages of optimization.</li>
  <li><i>instructions.html</i> - these instructions</li>
  <li><i>other</i> - illustrations and other junk</li>
</ul>
<p>These tutorials use a naming convention that keeps file names short, but unique. 
  The files necessary to begin Tutorial 0 are in the folder t0, etc. The cast 
  will grow to include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>t0s</b><u>x</u><b>m.cpp</b> - source code of your main program, for assignment 
    <u>x</u>.</li>
  <li><b>t0s</b><u>x</u><b></b><b>.c </b><i>or</i><b> 
    t0s</b><u>x</u><b></b><b>.s</b> - source code for your function in C
    or assembly language, for assignment <u>x</u>.</li>
  <li><i>t0s<u>x</u>m.o, t0s<u>x</u>.o</i> - your object files, compiled from 
    the source code.</li>
  <li><i>t0s<u>x</u></i> - your executable program</li>
</ul>
<p><b><a name="make"></a>make</b> <i>program</i></p>
<p>compiles and links the sourcefiles to make <i>program</i>. It can be complex
   to compile and link files in different languages, so we use the <span class="sourcecode">make</span> 
  program, along with rules written especially for this tutorial to issue these
   commands for us. Make is a very complex program, and writing makefiles is
  a  subtle art. You can learn more about make from the 
  <a href="../intro.html#make" target="intro">GNU `make'</a> reference online.
  If you stick to the naming conventions for tutorial assignments, the rules
  in your makefile should be adequate to compile and link your programs, with
  the hooks you need to run and debug them. </p>
<p>If you are trying to make a program named t5sd, for example, you will type 
  the make command and see </p>
<p><b><a name="gcc"></a>gcc</b> <i>options sourcefile</i></p>
<p>translates <i>sourcefile</i> to object code. For these tutorials, you do not 
  have to type the gcc commands yourself; the <a href="#make">make</a> program 
  figures out, based on the program you want to make, which sourcefiles to translate 
  and what options you need. If this command fails, it is usually because of a 
  syntax error in <i>sourcefile</i>.</p>
<p><b><a name="gcc"></a>c++</b> <b>-o</b><i> program objectfile objectfile</i></p>
<p>links the <i>objectfiles</i> together to form a complete <i>program</i>. For 
  these tutorials, you do not have to type the c++ commands yourself; the <a href="#make">make</a> 
  program figures out, based on the <i>program</i> you want to make, which <i>objectfiles</i> 
  to link. If this command fails, it is usually because the name or arguments 
  of a function in one sourcefile do not match those in another.</p>
<p><a name="program"></a><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono"><b>./<i>program</i></b></font></p>
<p>runs <i>program</i>. Once you create an executable program in Linux, it is 
  instantly part of the environment, and you can use your new program by typing 
  its name, the same way that you use make, kate, or any other program in your 
  linux system. The only hitch is a security feature--we don't want some hacker 
  to write a program that deletes all your files, name it <span class="sourcecode">make</span> or 
  <span class="sourcecode">ls</span> and put it where you might execute it accidentally. The prefix 
  <span class="sourcecode">./</span> in front of your program name ensures that you will execute the 
  program in your current directory.</p>
<p><a name="gdb"></a><b>gdb</b> <i>program</i></p>
<p>debugs <i>program</i> with the GNU Debugger. Like <a href="#make">make</a>,
   it is a large, complex program for debugging large projects in many different
   languages. A short list of gdb commands is listed in <a href="gdb.html" target="gdb">gdb.html</a>;
    a more comprehensive reference is  <a href="../intro.html#gdb" target="intro">Debugging with gdb</a>.</p>
<p><b><a name="cp"></a>cp</b> <i>oldfile</i> <i>newfile</i><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono"><b><i></i></b></font></p>
<p>copies <i>oldfile</i> to <i>newfile</i>. In Linux, even a simple command like 
  cp has dozens of optional arguments, but the simple one should work for now.</p>
