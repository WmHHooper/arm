<h1>t7: Optimization 1</h1>
<script>wNavbar()</script>
<P>This tutorial builds on the code from 
  <script>writeNamedTutorial('fib1')</script>
  and 
  <script>writeNamedTutorial('fib2')</script>, 
  by implementing
  the  Fibonacci program in a way that is somewhat faster, but still fully recursive.
   By removing many of the redundant instructions from the compiler-generated
  code,  this program is intended to clarify the essential ones, and to introduce
  some  simple principles of code optimization. To follow the commentary, you
  will want  to open the files 
  <a href="../t0/t0.c"s" target="t0">../t0/t0.c</a>, 
  <a href="../t6/t6.s" target="t6">../t6/t6.s</a>,
  and 
  <a href="t7.s" target="t7">t7.s</a> so that you can compare these files easily. Some
  lines you should notice in 
  <a href="t7.s" target="t7">t7.s</a> are:</P>
<blockquote> 
  <p>19-22: If we are dealing with the basis case (i &lt; 2), don't bother building
     a stack frame. Just put the return value into <span class="register">r0</span> and return.</p>
  <p>25-27: These lines are similar to lines 22-25 of 
    <a href="../t6/t6.s" target="t6">t6.s</a>. We do NOT 
    want to interfere with the essential stack frame mechanism. We save one instruction
    by pushing <span class="register">r0</span> 
    (<span class="sourcecode">=i-1</span>)
    onto the stack at the same time as 
    <span class="register">r11</span> and 
    <span class="register">lr</span>. We add 4 to the stack pointer
    to make one additional slot for 
    <span class="sourcecode">j</span>
    we don't need to save 
    <span class="sourcecode">k</span> 
    on the stack.</p>
  <p>28: Because of the way the test was performed in line 17, 
  <span class="register">r0</span> already
     contains the value i - 1, so we are ready to call Fib(i - 1).</p>
  <p>30-33: We save the value of j on the stack, then call Fib(i - 2). Note that 
    since we saved the value of i&nbsp;-&nbsp;1 on the stack, rather than i, we 
    only subtract 1 here.</p>
  <p>35-38: We retrieve j off the stack, add to k (which is in <span class="register">r0</span> after the call
     to Fib(i - 2)), and return. Note that the last two instructions are identical
     to lines 47-48 of 
     <a href="../t6/t6.s" target="t6">t6.s</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This program can be understood without resorting to the debugger. Change to
  the t6 directory, make and run  t6, and enter progressively larger
  values of N until it takes about three seconds to compute Fib(N). Then, make
  and run t7, and enter the same value of N. The improved program should compute
  the same result, but in much less time.</p>
<P><b>Self-Test</b></P>
<ol type="a">
  <li>(8) How does the stack frame for this program differ from the one for 
    <script>writeNamedTutorial('fib2')</script>? 
    Refer to the stack frame for the previous tutorial, 
    and sketch the equivalent stack frame
    for this tutorial. 
    (You should be able to do this without the debugger; but it's there
    if you need it. :-)</li>
  <li>(2) Revise the program, using the conditional instruction format of the
    ARM to eliminate the <span class="sourcecode">bgt recursion</span>
    instruction. Does the revised program run  faster or slower?</li>
  <li>(2) Note that we didn't bother to optimize the main() program. Why not?</li>
</ol>

<p><b>Assignment</b></p>
  
<p> Take the disassembled function you created in the previous tutorial, and
  rewrite it, eliminating unnecessary data movements. Typically, you can expect
  to reduce the size and running time of your function by 50%, without affecting
  the correctness of the algorithm. Make sure your improved version compiles
  and links with your main program from t0. Submit your program as <b>t6s</b><i>x</i><b>.s</b>,
  using the same letter <i>x</i> that
  you used  to submit your program in 
  <script>writeNamedTutorial('fib1')</script>. 
  Run your revised program, and
    copy the terminal session
  into <b>t6s</b><i>x</i><b>.log</b>, and submit that as well.</p>
