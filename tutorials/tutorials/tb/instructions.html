<h1>tb: Floating Point Exceptions</h1>
<script>wNavbar()</script>
<P>The VFP11 coprocessor in the
<script>writeLongMachineName()</script>
is an implementation of the ARM Vector
Floating-point Architecture (VFPv2). This processor contains its own status registers
and its own hardware to handle floating point exceptions. Because floating point
operations are executed by a co-processor rather than the ARM core, their exceptions
require coordination between the two logical pieces of hardware. For our purposes,
the co-processor register of interest is the Foating-Point
Status and Control Register (FPSCR). The FPSCR bit fields are
  described in the 
  <a href="../intro.html#ref" target="intro">ARM1176JZF-Sâ„¢ Technical Reference Manual</a>. </P>
<P>This program uses a simple computation to illustrate the
   handling of floating point exceptions. First, we examine 
   <a href="tbm.cpp" target="tbm">tbm.cpp</a>:</P>
<P class="hangingindent">17: as in 
  <script>writeNamedTutorial('handler1')</script>, 
  the exception handler takes
  one integer argument and returns a void result.</P>
<P class="hangingindent">18-20: these variables are shared with the handler,
  again as in 
  <script>writeNamedTutorial('handler1')</script>. 
  The new variable, new_cw, will hold a copy of the
  FPSCR.</P>
<P class="hangingindent">26-28, 42: these instructions notify the floating point
  co-processor to raise SIGFPE when it encounters Division by Zero and Invalid
  Operation exceptions. Without these instructions, floating point exceptions
  may be handled by the co-processor without any intervention from the core processor. Details
  of the <span class="sourcecode">_FPU_SETCW()</span> instruction are poorly documented, but you can read definitions
  of the constants and macros from the 
  <script>writeLongMachineName()</script>
  itself, with the command:</P>
<pre>... tb]$ <span class="userTyped">cat /usr/include/fpu_control.h</span> </pre>
<P class="hangingindent">30-34: these instructions, similar to those in 
  <script>writeNamedTutorial('handler1')</script>, 
  notify the ARM core processor to send floating point exceptions to our handler.</P>
<P>Next we observe 
  <a href="tb.s" target="tb">tb.s</a>:</P>
<P class="hangingindent">	15-16: store the signal in the shared variable last_signal.</P>
<P class="hangingindent">18-20: increment the counter.</P>
<P class="hangingindent">22-23: copy the FPSCR into the new_cw.</P>
<P>Compile and run tb, and enter <span class="userTyped">4 1</span> at the &gt; prompt. The program does the arithmetic
  without exception and reports <span class="sourcecode">sqrt(4/1) = 2</span>. Enter -4 1, thought, and the
  result is similar to this:</P>
<pre>sqrt(-4/1) = nan<br>status: 8 (Exec format error)<br>count: 1<br>cw: 0x80000301</pre>
<P>The special IEEE 754 quantity NaN was placed in 
  <span class="register">s0</span> by the co-processor, which
  also raised signal 8. A control word of 0x80000301shows
  that:</P>
<p class="hangingindent"><strong>bit 31</strong>: the result
  of the operation was negative.</p>
<p class="hangingindent"><strong>bits 9-8</strong>: that the _FPU_MASK_ZM  and
  _FPU_MASK_IM bits were set, trapping Division by Zero and Invalid Operations,
  respectively.</p>
<p class="hangingindent"><strong>bit 0</strong>: that an invalid operation has, in fact, occurred.</p>
<P>Continue, entering a mixture of valid and invalid operands. Entering <span class="userTyped">3
    0</span>, for example,
  returns the special value INF and produces a control word of 0x302, indicating
the Division by Zero exception.</P>
<p><b>Assignments</b></p>
<ol class="assignment">
  <li>Revise the program and its handler, to print &quot;Division by Zero&quot; when
    this exception is handled.</li>
  <li>Revise the program and its handler, to print &quot;Invalid Operation&quot; when
    this exception is handled.</li>
  <li>Write a handler  for overflow, and a main program to perform simple
    arithmetic that can, optionally, generate overflow.</li>
  <li>Write a handler for underflow, and a main program to perform simple
  arithmetic that can, optionally, generate underflow.</li>
  <li>Write a handler for the inexact exception, and a main program to perform
    simple arithmetic that can, optionally, generate  the inexact exception.</li>
