<p>This tutorial will be easy to do, but hard to understand. Make sure you can 
  follow what happens in this example, at the register level, before you move 
  on! </p>
<p>This tutorial introduces the <b>stack frame</b>. Typically, each function creates 
  its own stack frame, where it saves local variables and other crucial data. 
  As functions are called and return, the stack grows and shrinks one frame at 
  a time. The stack frame for the Fib() function is illustrated in the table on 
  your right. Recall from previous tutorials that the program counter 
  (<span class="register">pc</span>) is 
  in register 
  <b><span class="register">r15</span></b>. By convention, ARM programs also maintain a stack pointer 
  (<span class="register">sp</span>) in 
  <b><span class="register">r13</span></b>, a link register 
  (<span class="register">lr</span>) in 
  <b><span class="register">r14</span></b>, and a frame pointer
  (<span class="register">fp</span>) in 
  <b><span class="register">r11</span></b>. 
  Register allocations are described in more detail in the 
  <a href="../intro.html#ref" target="intro">Procedure Call Standard for the ARM Architecture</a>
<p>Within Fib(), the parameter <span class="sourcecode">i</span> 
  and each local variable 
  <span class="sourcecode">j</span> 
  and <span class="sourcecode">k</span> has a unique place in the stack frame, expressible as a fixed 
  offset from the frame pointer. The function moves these variables from their 
  locations into arbitrary registers, but they always return to their places on 
  the stack during function calls. This process can be inefficient, but it allows 
  an indefinite number of nested function calls to take place.</p>
<p>In Fib() the top of the stack 
   (the value of <span class="register">sp</span>),
   is one word above the location
   of <span class="sourcecode">k</span>, the last variable. In more complex functions, the stack
   grows 
  &quot;up&quot; 
  (<span class="register">sp</span> decreases numerically) from that location as values are
  pushed  onto the stack.</p>
<p>The program for this tutorial is an equivalent implementation of the Fibonacci
  program from 
  <script>writeNamedTutorial('handler1')</script>, 
  and was created with the commands:</p>
<pre class="hungindent">...t6]$ gcc -o t6.s -S ../t0/t0.c
...t6]$ gcc -o t6m.s -S ../t0/t0m.cpp</pre>
<p>As we examine this tutorial, we will  refer back to the original
  C++ program, comparing 
  <a href="t6.s" target="t6">t6.s</a> with 
  <a href="../t0/t0.c" target="t0">../t0/t0.c</a> 
  and <a href="t6m.s" target="t6m">t6m.s</a> with 
  <a href="../t0/t0m.cpp" target="t0m">../t0/t0m.cpp</a>.
  Without attempting to understand the entire main program, we can nevertheless
  skim for some useful details from
  <a href="t6m.s" target="t6m">t6m.s</a>:</p>
<div class="hangingindent"> 
<p>20-38: All the literal strings in the main program are collected here by the
   compiler and given consecutive LC### labels. The <span class="sourcecode">.section</span> compiler directive
   allows the linker to move this data to another part of the address space,
  away  from the executable code. </p>
<p>177-191: All the references to strings and other object are collected here.
  For example, the reference to cin in the C++ program maps to ._ZSt3cin
  on line 188.</p>
<p>57, 61, 65, ...: All the input and output operations, &lt;&lt; and &gt;&gt;,
   are translated by the compiler into calls to the matching &lt;iostream&gt; library
    function. For example, the <span class="sourcecode"><span class="sourcecode">cout &lt;&lt; ...</span></span> statement
    from lines 22-25 of <b>t0m.cpp</b>  become  calls to <span class="sourcecode">_ZStls...PKc</span> and
    <span class="sourcecode">_ZNSolsEPFRSoS_E</span>. Note that practically all
    the main program consists of calls to &lt;iostream&gt; 
  functions--one reason we have avoided this code until now.</p>
<p>84-88: These lines place the variable 
  <span class="sourcecode">n</span> into register
  <span class="register">r0</span>, call
  Fib(), and move the return value from 
  <span class="register">r0</span> into the variable 
  <span class="sourcecode">f</span>.
  (Why the transfer to 
  <span class="register">r3</span>? Compilation habit, we suppose!)</p>
</div>
<p>After this brief tour of the main program, let's turn our attention to the 
  function. Some notes on
  <a href="t6.s" target="t6">t6.s</a> are: </p>
<div class="hangingindent">
  <p>22-24: The crucial registers are all adjusted to the new stack frame. The
    <span class="sourcecode">stmfd</span> instruction, described in the 
    <a href="../intro.html#ref" target="intro">ARM Developer Suite Assembler Guide</a>,
       pushes registers 
       <strong><span class="register">r11</span>/strong> and 
       <strong><span class="register">lr</span></strong> onto
       the stack in one instruction, adjusting 
       <span class="register">sp</span> to point to
       the top of the new stack. The 
       <span class="sourcecode">add</span> instruction
       points 
       <span class="register">r11</span> to
       the bottom of the new stack frame. the sub instruction raises the top
       of the stack four places, to hold  the local variables (and one extra,
       probably  padding).</p>
<p>25-30: The compiler copies parameter 
  <span class="sourcecode">i</span> from
  <span class="register">r0</span> to its place
  on the stack, then copies it right back into 
  <span class="register">r3</span>. The C++ test 
  &quot;if (i &lt; 2)&quot; 
  on line 10 of
  <a href="../t0/t0m.cpp" target="t0m">t0m.cpp</a> is reversed in translation, to a forward
   branch when i &gt; 1. In the degenerate case, (Fib(1) or Fib(0)),  1 is stored
   in <span class="register">r3</span>. and we branch to the return code at label .L3.</p>
<p>32-36: These lines implement the statement &quot;<span class="sourcecode">j
    = Fib(i-1);</span>&quot; on line
  14 of
  <a href="../t0/t0.c" target="t0">t0.c</a>. 
  We see i copied out of the stack frame, decremented, and
   placed in <span class="register">r0</span>. 
   After the recursive call, the result is moved to 
   <span class="register">r3</span>, then copied
   into the stack frame.</p>
<p>37-41: Similarly, compare these lines to the statement &quot;<span class="sourcecode">k
    = Fib(i-2);</span>&quot; 
  on line 15 of 
  <a href="../t0/t0.c" target="t0">t0.c</a>.</p>
<p>42-44: Compare to &quot;<span class="sourcecode">return
  j + k;</span>&quot; on line 16 of 
  <a href="../t0/t0.c" target="t0">t0.c</a>. 
</p>
<p>46: No matter how we reached line 46, the Fibonacci number is in register
  <span class="register">r3</span>, so we copy it to 
  <span class="register">r0</span> as our return value.</p>
<p>47-48: These instructions are symmetrical to the stack building instructions
  in lines 22-23, with a slight twist. The <span class="sourcecode">sub</span> instruction
  restores the stack pointer to the value it had after the stmfd instruction
  in line 22. The <span class="sourcecode">ldmfd</span> instruction
  then does three things at the same time: it restores 
  <strong><span class="register">r11</span>/strong> from
  its place in the stack, loads the return address (stored from 
  <strong><span class="register">lr</span></strong>)
  into the 
  <strong><span class="register">pc</span></strong>, and increments 
  <strong><span class="register">sp</span></strong> back to the
  old top of the stack. After this instruction, the processor is executing at
  the same location, with the same stack frame, that it had before Fib was called.</p>
</div>
<p> Make and run this program, and verify that it indeed computes Fibonacci numbers,
  just as the C++ program did in 
  <script>writeNamedTutorial('fib1')</script>; 
  then use gdb to trace its execution.
  Excerpts from a gdb session are shown below. When you run this program, the
  numbers will be similar though not identical. (Because memory is never empty,
  it is normal to find values in memory that were not written by your program.
  These values are <span class="ignore">highlighted in gray</span> in the examples
  that follow:
<pre class="hungindent">... t6]$ <span class="userTyped">gdb t6</span>
Reading symbols from ...t6...done.
(gdb) break Fib
Breakpoint 1 at 0x8914
(gdb) <span class="userTyped">run</span>
...
n> <span class="userTyped">3</span>

Breakpoint 1, 0x00008914 in Fib ()
8: x/24xw $sp

...
8: /d $r0  = 3
...
4: /x $fp  = 0xbefffb88
3: /x $lr  = 0x8a00
2: x/i $pc
=> 0x8914 <Fib>:        push    {r11, lr}
1: /x $cpsr = 0x10
(gdb) </pre>

<p>The details of the stack frame for main() are best ignored. For now, 
  note the top of the stack: in the example above it's the <span class="sourcecode">0xbefffb94</span> value
  at location <span class="sourcecode">0x...b88</span>. As items are pushed and
  popped on the stack, you will see this same hex pattern appear to move around
  in the display; use it as a landmark for the initial top of stack.
<p>The compiler, assembler and debugger appear to have been written by different
  authors at different times. Compare the instruction at  <span class="sourcecode">0x8914</span> with
  line 22 of 
  <a href="t6.s" target="t6">t6.s</a>: you'll see that gdb
  has translated  
  <span class="sourcecode">stmfd sp!, {fp, lr}</span> to   
  <span class="sourcecode">push {r11, lr}</span>. 
 Also, take care to refer to the frame pointer as <span class="register">r11</span> when
 you use gdb; the assembler and debugger appear to recognize a different registers
 as 
 <span class="register">lr</span>.
<p>Use the <span class="userTyped">si</span> instruction to step forward. As instructions in lines
  22-25 of 
  <a href="t6.s" target="t6">t6.s</a> execute, the stack frame
  for fib(3) is built and the variable <span class="sourcecode">i</span> is stored in it's slot. When execution
  reaches the <span class="sourcecode">ldr</span> instruction,
  the debugger display should look similar to this:
<pre class="hungindent">...
(gdb) <span class="userTyped">si</span>

0xbefffb70: <span class="ignore">0x00000002</span>  0x00000003  <span class="ignore">0x00000008  0xbefffb94</span>
0xbefffb80: 0xbefffbb4  0x00008a00  <span class="ignore">0xbefffb94  0x00008bec</span>

8: /d $r0 = 3

4: /x $fp = 0xbefffb84
3: /x $lr = 0x8a00
2: x/i $pc
=> 0x8924 &lt;Fib+16>:     ldr     r3, [r11, #-16]
1: /x $cpsr = 0x10
(gdb) </pre>
<p>Note that the stack has moved up 24 bytes, decreasing in the example from
  <span class="sourcecode">0x...b88</span> to <span class="sourcecode">0x...b70</span>.
  The frame pointer now points one location above the old top of stack. it's
  old value as well as the value in the link register are saved at the bottom
  of the stack frame. The current value of 
  <span class="sourcecode">i</span> is stored at 
  <span class="sourcecode">[lr, #-16]</span> .
<p>Either step or continue until Fib() is reached again, then step  through
   lines
  22-25 of 
  <a href="t6.s" target="t6">t6.s</a> again. The 
   debugger  should display the stack frame for Fib(2), similar to
  this:
<pre class="hungindent">...
(gdb) <span class="userTyped">si</span>
0x00008924 in Fib ()
9: x/24xw $sp
0xbefffb58: <span class="ignore">0x00000000</span>  0x00000002  <span class="ignore">0x000087e0  0x00000000</span>

8: /d $r0 = 2
...
4: /x $r11 = 0xbefffb6c
3: /x $r14 = 0x8948
2: x/i $pc
=> 0x8924 &lt;Fib+16>:     ldr     r3, [r11, #-16]
1: /x $cpsr = 0x20000010
(gdb) </pre>
<p>Note that the 
  <span class="sourcecode">3</span> is still there, 24 bytes below the 
  <span class="sourcecode">2</span> on the stack.
   Either step or continue until Fib() is reached again, then step  through
   lines
  22-25 of 
  <a href="t6.s" target="t6">t6.s</a> again. The  debugger
   should display the stack frame for Fib(1). Viewing
  the stack, you can find the argument values 
  <span class="sourcecode">0x...1</span>, 
  <span class="sourcecode">0x...2</span>,
  and 
  <span class="sourcecode">0x...3</span>, each separated by 24
  bytes. You can also trace the frame pointers, threaded down the stack.
<p>Since <span class="sourcecode">i</span> is equal to 1, the branch at line 28 is skipped. Execution therefore
   proceeds through lines 29 and 30, then skips to line 46. Watch the display
  carefully  as lines 47 and 48 execute. The <span class="sourcecode">sub</span> instruction drops  the stack
  16 bytes, and the value <span class="sourcecode">1</span> disappears from the stack display. The <span class="sourcecode">ldmfd</span>
  instruction, labelled <span class="sourcecode">pop</span> by the disassembler,
  does three things at once:  
  <span class="register">lr</span> is read from 
  <span class="sourcecode">[sp]</span> (though
  this time, its value does not change),  
  <span class="register">pc</span> is
  read from 
  <span class="sourcecode">[sp, #4]</span>, and 
  <span class="register">sp</span> increases by 8. Fib(1) has returned the value 1
  in 
  <span class="register">r0</span>.
<p>Resuming the execution of Fib(2), the program stores the return value (j =
  1) onto the stack at <span class="sourcecode">[fp, #-8]</span>. It then retrieves the current argument (i =
  2) from stack, subtracts 2 and calls Fib(0). While many of the register movements
  are unnecessary, the use of the stack to hold i and j is essential.</p>
<p>Stepping quickly through the next instructions, you can follow the execution
   of Fib(0), which builds a stack frame on the same addresses used earlier by
  Fib(1). Fib(0) returns 1, which is stored on the stack (unnecessarily),
  then added to the 1 returned by Fib(1) and retrieved from the stack (necessarily).
  Fib(2) adds the intermediate results and returns 2 in 
  <span class="register">r0</span>. Fib(3) resumes
  . . . when you are sure you can predict the movements into and out of registers,
    and onto and off of the stack, use the gdb command <span class="sourcecode">continue</span> to
    resume execution. You can run the program with other arguments, or use the
    gdb command <span class="sourcecode">quit</span> 
  to exit.</p>
<p><b>Self-Test</b></p>
<ol>
  <li> (8) Sketch the stack frames created when this program computes Fib(4).
     Show the relative locations and values saved from registers 
     <span class="register">r0..r3</span>, 
     <span class="register">r11</span>, and
     <span class="register">pc</span>.</li>
  <li> (5) Annotate the assembly listing of 
  <a href="t6.s" target="t6">t6.s</a>, by labelling each group 
    of instructions with the C++ statements from 
    <a href="../t0/t0.c" target="t0">t0.c</a> which are being 
    carried out by the instructions.</li>
  <li>(3) Note that this program saves a great deal of unnecessary information 
    in the stack frame. Some data never changes; other values change, but the 
    changed values are never reused. Mark the unnecessary instructions which could 
    be deleted from this program, and explain why each deleted instruction is 
    unnecessary.</li>
  <li>(3) Suppose the stack segment has a size of 8 kilobytes (word addresses 
    <span class="sourcecode">0xbffff000</span> to <span class="sourcecode">0xbfffffffc</span>). What's the largest Fibonacci number we can compute 
    without running out of stack space?</li>
