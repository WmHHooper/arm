<h1> t1: Introducing Assembly</h1>
<script>wNavbar()</script>
<p>This tutorial is our introduction to the 
  <script>writeLongMachineName()</script>
assembly language, and to
  the  linking conventions we will use to link C++ and assembly into a single
  program.  As in our first tutorial, the program is divided into halves: a main
  program  and a function. The main program, 
  <a href="t1m.cpp" target="t1m">t1m.cpp</a>, looks
  very  similar to the main program in the first tutorial. Open it with your
  text editor and note a few differences:</p>
<div class="hangingindent"> 
<p>11: We declare the assembly routine, in this case <span class="sourcecode">ftoc()</span>, as an external 
  "C" function, even though it's actually written in Assembly.This function has
  one argument, and returns an integer result. if we fail to write this declaration
  correctly, the two parts of the program will not link, or the values will not
  be passed or returned correctly.</p>
<p>18: <span class="sourcecode">ftoc()</span> is called as any function written in C++ would be. Here it is passed 
  the Fahrenheit temperature as an <span class="sourcecode">int</span>, and expected to return the Centigrade 
  temperature as another <span class="sourcecode">int</span>. As in the first tutorial, the function call is placed 
  in a loop, so that we can call the function as many times as we wish without 
  restarting the program.</p>
</div>
<p>In contrast with our main file, the function definiton is very different;
  and  the difference begins with the name. In the name <a href="t1.s" target="t1">t1.s</a>, the
  suffix <a href="t1.s" target="t1">.s</a> means
  that the file is in assembly. Open <a href="t1.s" target="t1">t1.s</a>,
   and observe:</p>
<div class="hangingindent"> 
<p>1-8: Comments begin with an "@" character, and end at the end of the line. 
  <u>Every file you submit must include initial comments listing your name, the 
  course, and the assignment number, and that describe the program you are submitting.</u></p>
<p>10-13: These directives begin assembly of the program in a code segment, ensure
   that instructions are written at even addresses, and declare <span class="sourcecode">ftoc</span> 
  as a function that can be called from another file. For now, just keep in mind
  that you will need to begin every program with the same four instructions,
  and that you must use exactly the same name--in this case, "ftoc"--that
  is declared  in the C++ program.</p>
<p>16-19: The next 4 lines are assembly language instructions, as described in
   Appendix D of <a href="../intro.html#ref" target="intro">the text</a> and
   in the 
   <a href="../intro.html#ref" target="intro">ARM Developer Suite Assembler Guide</a>.
   They take the value in register 
   <span class="register">r0</span>, apply the conversion formula to it, and
   put the result back into 
   <span class="register">r0</span>. If you are writing a function with more
   than one argument, the arguments are found in registers 
   <span class="register">r0</span>, 
   <span class="register">r1</span>, 
   <span class="register">r2</span>, ... etc.<br>
   <br>
   The arithmetic here warrants a special note. The ARM processor in the
   <script>writeLongMachineName()</script> 
has
   no built-in division unit, so we cannot divide by 9. Instead we note that
   <span class="sourcecode">5/9 &lt;=
   0.10001111<sub>2</sub> = 0x8F</span>. Therefore, multiplying an integer by
   0x8F and shifting the binary point left 8 bits approximates muktiplication
   by 5/9. The use of fixed-point arithmetic is described in more detail in 
   <a href="../intro.html#ref" target="intro">Fixed Point Arithmetic on the ARM</a>.</p>
<p>21: This instruction returns control to the main program, much like a <span class="sourcecode">return</span> 
  statement in C++.</p>
<p>23-25: These assembly directives indicate
  the length of the function, and put identification directly into the program
  object code. <u>Every
  program you compile must include identification of your name, the course, and
  the assignment.</u></p>

<p>The dialog to create and run this program is almost identical to that in
  <script>writeNamedTutorial('fib1')</script>. 
  The command <span class="userTyped">make t1</span> causes the compiler to translate 
  <a href="t1.s" target="t1">t1.s</a> and 
  <a href="t1m.cpp" target="t1m">t1m.cpp</a>
  into object code, then link the objects together. If the process 
  completes without error, we have an executable program named <span class="sourcecode">t1</span>, 
  which we execute by typing <span class="sourcecode">./t1</span>. </p>
<p>The program will prompt for a temperature in Fahrenheit, and reply with the
   Centigrade equivalent --rounded down to the next integer. Enter some temperatures,
   and use a calculator to check that your copy of the program makes the correct
   conversion. Enter a 'q' to quit.When the program quits, the command
   interpreter resumes, printing out another <span class="sourcecode">...t1]$</span> prompt.</p>

<p><a name="figure1"></a>Now that the program works, let's examine its behavior
   in more detail. To use a debugger well, we need to decide in advance what
  we  want to watch and when we want to see it. Otherwise, we will be overwhelmed
   by thousands of instructions, most of them doing things best taken for granted.
   This debugger has already been set up to watch the first five registers and
   the program counter. Our first command, &quot;<span class="userTyped">break
   ftoc</span>&quot;, tells the
   debugger to stop at the beginning of the ftoc() function. </p>
<p>Enter <span class="userTyped">r</span> or <span class="userTyped">run</span> to
  run the program. It runs just as before, prompting us for a temperature. Here
  we type in <span class="userTyped">68</span>, one of the
  tempratures we tried before. When the program reaches our breakpoint, it stops
  and gdb prints out the values of various registers. </p>
<p>Once you begin reading the gdb output, you can follow your programs
   precisely. The other registers are unimportant just yet; the critical ones
  are
  <span class="register">r0</span>, where the temperature is stored (68 = 0x44), and the 
  <span class="register">pc</span> which points
  to  the next instruction. This instruction, 
  <span class="sourcecode">sub r1, r0, #32</span> happens
   to be first instruction in the function ftoc(). </p>
<p>Enter <span class="userTyped">si</span>. The program 
  <span class="userTyped">s</span>teps
  forward, executing one <span class="userTyped">i</span>nstruction and
  printing the new values. Comparing registers
  <span class="register">r0</span> and
  <span class="register">r1</span>, we see that
  <span class="register">r1</span> indeed contains
  <span class="register">r0</span> - 32 (68 - 32 = 36 = 0x24). Meanwhile, the 
  <span class="register">pc</span>has moved, and is
  ready to execute the <span class="sourcecode">ldr</span> instruction.</p>
<p>Step through the next 3 instructions by pressing <span class="userTyped">Enter</span> at
  the prompt, observing the changes as you go. The fraction 5/9, approximately
  143/256, is loaded into
<span class="register">r2</span>. Multiplying 143 x 36 produces 5148 = 0x141c which
  is stored in
<span class="register">r3</span>. Shifting 0x141c right by 8 bits divides the number by 256,
  yielding 0x14 = 20, which is placed in
<span class="register">r0</span>. What could be easier!</p>
<p>We do not want to step through the instructions in main, so  enter 
   <span class="userTyped">cont</span> or 
   <span class="userTyped">continue</span>.
   This resumes the program, which correctly displays the Centigrade conversion,
   and prompts for another Fahrenheit temperature. </p>
<p> Repeat this process with a different temperature. Look up each 
  instruction, predict what change it will make in the registers, then step through
  the instruction and verify that the change was made. When you reach the 
  <span class="sourcecode">mov pc, lr</span>
  instruction, the correct Fahrenheit temperature (in hex) will be in
<span class="register">r0</span>, and
  when you enter 
  <span class="userTyped">cont</span> the corresponding decimal value will appear.</p>
<p><b>A Note on Registers</b></p>
<p>This function uses four registers,
  <span class="register">r0</span>-<span class="register">r3</span>. 
  There are 16 registers in all, but
  you must handle the upper 12 with care. Details are found on p.14 of the 
  <a href="../intro.html#ref" target="intro">Procedure Call Standard for the ARM Architecture</a>, 
  and will be dealt with in a later
  tutorial, but  if you can stick to
  <span class="register">r0</span>-<span class="register">r3</span> 
  your code will be simpler.</p>
<p><b>Self Tests</b></p>
<p>Since you are <u>not allowed to use the machines</u> at test time, you should
   try these exercises with pencil, paper, and calculator. You can then use the
   machine to check your answers and grade yourself. Numbers in parenthesis ()
   indicate the approximate value the question would have on a test, and is therefore
   a guide to the amount of work required.</p>
<ol>
  <li>(4) Suppose the program is run, and the user enters a value of 35 when
    prompted  for a Fahrenheit temperature. List <u>each value</u> stored in
    registers
<span class="register">r0</span>,
<span class="register">r1</span>,
<span class="register">r2</span>, and
<span class="register">r3</span>, in hex, during the execution of the function
    ftoc(). </li>
  <li> (2) Assume that arguments a, b, and c are passed to the following function.
    Write out the formula computed by its instructions.
<pre>
mul r4, r2, r2
mul r5, r0, #4
mul r5, r5, r3
sub r0, r4, r5</pre></li>
<li>(2+) Enter various positive and negative temperatures.  Integer arithmetic
  seldom produces exact answers, but  you will notice a consistent
  error in the conversion process. Modify ftoc()
  to produce the closest integer approximation of the correct Centigrade temperature. (We
  have not covered branches, and no conditional expressions are needed for a
  solution, just some math. :-)</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Assignment</b></p>
<p>You will be assigned one of the following functions in class; you are encouraged
  to do as many others as you need. </p>
<p>In the C++ file, change the main program to prompt for the arguments needed, 
  call the function by the name listed, and print the value returned.</p>
<ol class="assignment">
  <li><img src="trap.gif" width="71" height="61" hspace="10" align="right"><span class="sourcecode">int
     average(a, b, c, d)</span> returns the average of a, b, c, and d (hint: to divide
     by 4, shift 2 bits right).</li>
  <li><span class="sourcecode">int inches(f, i)</span> returns the total number of inches corresponding to f feet, 
    i inches.</li>
  <li><span class="sourcecode">char lower(char c)</span> returns the lowercase equivalent of c.&#9;</li>
  <li><span class="sourcecode">int remainder(n, d)</span> returns the remainder
    of n divided by d.</li>
  <li><span class="sourcecode">int parabola(x)</span> returns the value x2 - 3x + 2.</li>
  <li><span class="sourcecode">int trap(b1, b2, h)</span> returns the area of a trapezoid as shown:</li>
  <li><span class="sourcecode">int kinetic(m,v)</span> returns the kinetic energy of an object of mass m and velocity 
    v. </li>
</ol>
<p>To begin, copy the files 
  <a href="t1m.cpp" target="t1m">t1m.cpp</a> and 
  <a href="t1.s" target="t1">t1.s</a>, 
  and rename the copies <b>t1s</b><i>x</i><b>m.cpp</b> and <b>t1s</b><i>x</i><b>.s</b>,
  replacing the <i>x</i><b> </b>with the letter of the problem you are assigned.
Edit <b>t1s</b><i>x</i><b>.s</b> to implement the new function, and <b>t1s</b><i>x</i><b>m.cpp</b> to
prompt for values, call the function and print the result, in the same kind of
loop as <strong>t1m.cpp</strong>. When you have run and tested your program and
found it to work correctly, email <b>t1s</b><i>x</i><b>m.cpp</b> and <b>t1s</b><i>x</i><b>.s</b> to:</p>
