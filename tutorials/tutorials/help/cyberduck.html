<ol>
  <li>Install tools:
    <ol>
      <li>Download and install TextWrangler from:<br />
        <a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/" target="download">http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/</a></li>
      <li>Download and install Cyberduck from:<br />
      <a href="http://cyberduck.ch/" target="download">http://cyberduck.ch/</a></li>
      <li>Launch  Cyberduck, and choose <strong>Preferences...</strong> from
        the Cyberduck menu. Configure Cyberduck to work with TextWrangler by
        choosing it in the Edit Preferences, as shown below:<br />

    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Connect to the CSC File Server:
    <ol>
      <li>Launch Cyberduck. The main connection window will show a list of previous
        connections (which will be empty if you have not used Cyberduck before).
        Click the button that says &quot;Open Connection&quot; and you should reach the
        host selection window below:<br />
      <img src="images/cyberduck-connect.png" width="605" height="524" alt="winscp" />        </li>
      <li>Enter <strong>csc.belmont.edu</strong> as the Host Name, and be sure
        to select the <strong>SFTP</strong> Protocol. Cyberduck should select
        Port number 22 automatically when you select <strong>SFTP</strong>. Enter
        your User name and password, then click the <strong>Connect</strong> button.
        The first time you do this, you will be prompted to accept the host key
        from the CSC Server. Click <strong>Yes</strong>, and you should see a
      new screen like the following:<br />
      <img src="images/cyberduck-home.png" width="524" height="280" alt="home" /></li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Navigate to the tutorial.</li>
  <ol>
    <li>Double-click the private folder. The address will change to &quot;/home/csc/<em>username</em>/private/&quot;
      window will change to show the contents of your public folder.</li>
    <li>Double-click the csc2110 folder. Note the change in address and view.</li>
    <li>Double-click the tutorials folder. Note the change in address and view.</li>
    <li>Double-click the  folder for your current tutorial. The address should read &quot;/home/csc/<em>username</em>/private/csc2110/tutorials/t<em>N</em>/&quot;,
      where N is the letter of your tutorial, and the folder window should
      display the files for your tutorial. The folder for Tutorial 0 is shown
      below as an example.<br />
    <img src="images/cyberduck-t0.png" width="494" height="279" alt="t0" />      </li>
  </ol>
  <li>Edit files:
    <ol>
      <li>To edit a file, for example t0m.cpp, right-click the file and choose
        <strong>Edit With -&gt; TextWrangler</strong> from the pop-up menu. An
        editor window appears
        like the one below:<br />
      <img src="images/textwrangler.png" width="404" height="188" alt="edit" />      </li>
      <li>Note the line numbers along the left side of the window. As you
        debug files,  line numbers will guide you to checkpoints and errors.</li>
      <li>The write icon <img src="images/textwrangler-icon.jpg" alt="disk" width="9" height="9" align="bottom" />,
        on the left side of the toolbar, is white when the file you are editing
        is in sync with the copy on the Playstation 3, but turns black when you
        make changes that have not yet been saved. Normally, you will want to
        save early and often! Each time you save changes, the notification &quot;<strong>File
        Uploaded</strong>&quot; should appear in the upper right corner of your Macintosh
        desktop.</li>
      <li>You can open as many edit windows as you need to do the tutorial, and
        leave them open as long as you need. Close
        the edit windows when you are done; you
        will be prompted to save any final changes.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Disconnect
    <ol>
      <li>Before you disconnect, be sure that all your remote TextWrangler windows
        are closed. If you forget this step,  changes to your TextWrangler
        files may not be written to the PlayStation 3.</li>
      <li>Choose <strong>Quit</strong> from the <strong>Cyberduck</strong> menu. Cyberduck
        will close without confirmation. To resume, return to step 2.1 .</li>
      <li>If you leave your computer while the <strong>Cyberduck</strong> window is open, it will
        eventually disconnect from the server on its own. When you return, you
        will be prompted to restore the connection; however, you will have to
        wait for the connection to be re-established, and you may have to return
        to Step 2.1 in order to complete the connection.</li>
