<h1>t3: Addressing Modes, Part I</h1>
<script>wNavbar()</script>
<p>Arrays, reference parameters, and file access all rely on <i>indirect modes</i> 
  of address at the machine language level. As described in sections 2.5 and 3.1.2 
  of your text, the ARM processor has many indirect modes. This tutorial uses 
  <i>register index mode </i>to manipulate an array of characters (i.e., a string). 
  The file <a href="t3m.cpp" target="source">t3m.cpp</a> has one important detail:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p> 11: In this declaration, "<b>char</b> s[]" is an <i>array</i> parameter
     passed to the procedure NoCaps(). This is the first parameter passed by
    reference,  and all other reference parameters will follow this pattern.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some notable features of 
<a href="t3.s" target="t3">t3.s</a> are on the following lines:</p>
<p class="hangingindent"> 15, 30: We have to copy the link register to a safe
  place, because it may be overwritten by later subroutine calls.
  When we reach the end of the string at line 30, copying
<span class="register">r2</span> back into the program
  counter will return execution to main().</p>
<p class="hangingindent">16, 37: This is our first example of indexed addressing,
  although it looks simpler than it appears. As
  the
  assembler translates this program into machine code,   it resolves the reference
  to <span class="sourcecode">data</span> by
  counting the number of bytes from the load instruction to the <span class="sourcecode">data:</span>
  label and adjusts for prefetching. It rewrites the instruction as: 
  <span class="sourcecode">ldr r3, [pc, #40]</span> .</p>
<p class="hangingindent">17: Branch to the loop test. The safest and most efficient
  way to write a loop is to place the primary loop test at the end, branching
  backwards as long as the test condition is true. When the test fails, execution
  simply falls out of the loop to the  instructions that follow. The body of
  the loop is more efficient this way, but requires this branch to skip the loop
  body the first time through.</p>
<p class="hangingindent">25: This <span class="sourcecode">ldrb</span> instruction
  is our second example  of indexed
    addressing. Here, 
   <span class="register">r0</span> 
   points to a character from the string 
   <span class="sourcecode">s</span>, specified in the
    source code to main(). The instruction loads one byte from this address into
   
<span class="register">r1</span>. Since
<span class="register">r0</span> is incremented inside the loop, this instruction fetches a new
    element of the array each time it's executed.</p>
<p class="hangingindent">26-27: Strings in C and C++ end with a <i>null character</i>,
  a byte which  has the numerical value of zero. We are comparing
<span class="register">r1</span> with zero
  to test for the null character that marks the end of the string. When
  the test fails, the branch is skipped and we fall to the return instruction.</p>
<p class="hangingindent">20: If the character is already lowercase, we need to
  skip the conversion  and test the next character.
<span class="register">r3</span> contains the ASCII
  character 'Z', so  any character less than or equal to
<span class="register">r3</span> must be in uppercase.</p>
<p class="hangingindent">21-22: Here we look at another form of branching, used
  to implement subroutines. When the <span class="sourcecode">bl__</span> instruction
  branches, it saves a copy of the program counter in a link register. Control
  transfers to <span class="sourcecode">lower:</span> as in any other 
    branch; but at the  <span class="sourcecode">move pc, lr</span>  instruction
    control passes back to the address in the link register. The  
    <span class="sourcecode">bl ... mov pc, lr</span>  instruction pair is used for
  all subroutine calls and returns. Whether we take the branch or not, we must
  increment
<span class="register">r0</span> to point to the next character.</p>
<p class="hangingindent">32-34: To understand this manipulation, it 
  will help to review the ASCII table in Appendix E. All ASCII capital letters
  differ from their lowercase equivalents by one bit in  position 5. ORing
  them with the bit pattern 0x20 sets this fifth bit, converting them to lowercase.
  For example:</p>
<pre>
     'E'       0100 0101
 <u>or 0x20</u>    <u>or 0010 0000</u>
     'e'       0110 0101</pre>
<p class="hungindent">The converted character is stored back into the array,
  at the same effective address <span class="sourcecode">[r0]</span> where
  it was loaded. We then return to the loop, resuming execution at line 22.</p>
<p>As usual, you should run this program and verify its operation. Be sure to
  enter strings that include digits and punctuation. At the "&gt; " prompt, enter
  a few capitalized words; the program will echo these back to you with all
  the letters in lower case. Press <i><u>return</u></i> without
  entering a string, and the program will quit.</p>
<p>Before we use the debugger, it's time to take a look at A quick look at the <a href="gdb.ini" target="source">gdb.ini</a> file
  will illustrate some useful debugging techniques. Note in particular the lines:</p>
<pre>...
display/s $r0
display/16bx $r0
display/x $r0</pre>
<p>Because the array
  is passed by reference, 
  <span class="register">r0</span> contains a pointer to the characters in the string,
  rather than the characters themselves. The command 
  <span class="sourcecode">display/16xb $r0</span> displays
  sixteen bytes in hexadecimal, beginning at the location in 
  <span class="register">r0</span>. The command 
  <span class="sourcecode">display/s $r0</span> displays
     the same region of memory, but this time as a string. If you were debugging
     an array of integers, a display option like 
     <span class="sourcecode">/16xw</span>
     would be more legible than 
     <span class="sourcecode">/16xb</span>,
     and <span class="sourcecode">/s</span>
     would not be useful at all. More debugging options are described in the
     <a href="../intro.html#ref" target="intro">Debugging with gdb</a>.</p>
<p>Use gdb to debug t3. Set a breakpoint at NoCaps, then run the program and
  enter  the string 
  <span class="userTyped">Hi, U!</span>, the display will look
  similar to the following:</p>
<pre>
9: /x $r0 = 0xbefffab0
8: x/16xb $r0
0xbefffab0: 0x48 0x69 0x2c 0x20 0x55 0x21 0x00 0x00
0xbefffab8: 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00
7: x/s $r0  0xbefffab0: "Hi, U!"
...</pre>
<p> You can verify that the hexadecimal codes displayed at 8: are equivalent
  to  the string displayed at 7: . As you step through the loop, you
  will see the first character change from 0x48 ('H') to 0x68 ('h'), while the
  lowercase character and punctuation remain the same. You will also see the
  string appear to shrink as
<span class="register">r0</span> is incremented.</p>
<p>An alternative to stepping through each statement is to put a breakpoint in 
  the loop, for example at the <span class="sourcecode">bne</span> statement. Once the break is in place, you 
  can continue from the break each time, to see the execution of a complete loop. 
  Each iteration of the loop will change at most one character.</p>
<p><b>Self Test</b></p>
<ol>
  <li> (4) Suppose the string: <span class="userTyped">Oh!</span> were entered at the prompt. List the values
    in
<span class="register">r1</span> and
<span class="register">r2</span>, each time execution reaches the "bne" statement.</li>
  <li> (2)&#9;Why is the comparison with 'Z' necessary? List a string that
    would be incorrectly converted, if this test and the branch were commented
    out.</li>
  <li> (2) Why is the <span class="sourcecode">or</span> operation used, instead of 
  <span class="sourcecode">add</span>?
    List a string that would be incorrectly converted by an add instruction.</li>
  <li> (1) When you enter successive strings, then display memory in the debugger,
    the result looks oddly scrambled. For example, if you enter the strings:</li>
<pre><font size="1">&gt; THIS IS A TEST.
  this is a test.
&gt; and ANOTHER
  and another
&gt; 3rd Time</font></pre>
and display memory during the interrupt on the third try, you will see a hex 
    dump similar to this:
<pre>
8: x/16xb $r0
0xbefffab0:  0x33 0x72 0x64 0x20 0x54 0x69 0x6d 0x65
0xbefffab8:  0x00 0x65 0x72 0x00 0x73 0x74 0x2e 0x00</pre>
what are the characters 0x68 ... 0x2e doing at the end of the string, and
    why don't they display on the next line?
  <li> (3) Change this function to convert all the lowercase characters to
    uppercase. (Warning: check your characters carefully!)</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Assignments</b></p>
<p>Write the following procedures or functions in assembly language, with an
  appropriate  C++ main program to prompt for arguments and display results.
  Note that you will want to edit the <a href="gdb.ini" target="gdb">gdb.ini</a> file
  to display arguments appropriately.</p>
<ol class="assignment">
  <li><span class="sourcecode">int max(int* A, int N)</span> returns the largest value in integer array A, of
    length N.</li>
  <li><span class="sourcecode"> int vowels(char* S)</span> returns the number of vowels in string S.</li>
  <li><span class="sourcecode"> int sum(int* A, int N)</span> returns the sum of integer array A, of length N.</li>
  <li><span class="sourcecode"> int compare(char* R, char*  S)</span> compares strings R and S, returning 1 if
    R&gt;S, 0 if
    R=S, and -1 if R&lt;S.</li>
  <li> <span class="sourcecode">int find(char* S, int c)</span> returns the first location of character c in
    string S, or -1 if c is not found.</li>
  <li> <span class="sourcecode">int copyabc(char* R, char* S)</span> copies the letters in string R to S. <br>
    (for example, if R = "Hello, World!" then S = "HelloWorld")</li>
