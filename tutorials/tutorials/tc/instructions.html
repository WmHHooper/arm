<h1>tc: Pipelines and Optimization</h1>
<script>wNavbar()</script>
<P>Like all modern processors, the ARM family is designed to execute instructions
   in parallel, beginning a new instruction before previous instructions have
  completed.  This behavior does not affect the correctness of a typical (timing
  independent)  program, but it has a significant effect on the program&#146;s
  performance. Pipeline strategies vary from chip to chip in the ARM family,
  but several optimization techniques are common to all of them.</P>
<P>This tutorial uses the same main program as in 
   <script>writeNamedTutorial('dotprod1')</script>, applying successive optimizations to improve performance. In particular:
   <a href="tcm.cpp" target="tcm">tcm.cpp</a> is identical to 
   <a href="../t9/t9m.cpp" target="t9m">t9m.cpp</a>, 
   <a href="tcv0.c" target="tcv0">tcv0.c</a> is identical to 
   <a href="../t9/t9v0.c" target="t9v0">t9v0.c</a>, and 
   <a href="tcv1.s" target="tcv1">tcv1.s</a> is identical to 
   <a href="../t9/t9v1.s" target="t9v1">t9v1.s</a>. The new files are 
   <a href="tcv2.s" target="tcv2">tcv2.s</a> and 
   <a href="tcv3.s" target="tcv3">tcv3.s</a>. First,
   let's review 
   <a href="tcv2.s" target="tcv2">tcv2.s</a>, a simple modification
   of version 1:</P>
<p class="hangingindent">26-32: These lines are simply  duplicate  lines 19-25. This
  process of  <em>unrolling the loop</em> reduces the number of branch penalties we
  suffer as the program executes.</p>
<P>There are a few more modifications in 
  <a href="tcv3.s" target="tcv3">tcv3.s</a>:</P>
<P class="hangingindent">19-22: All the load operations are done sequentially,
  to keep the ARM pipeline stages operating in lockstep. Consecutive memory locations
  are loaded in sequence, to improve the cache hit ratio.</P>
<P class="hangingindent">23-25: We move the integer operations here,  allowing
  the floating point operands time to load before they are used.</P>
<P class="hangingindent">26-29: We use additional registers  to reduce the
  number of data dependencies.</P>
<P>Make  tcv0, tcv1, tcv2, and tcv3, and run each program on the same
  vectors to ensure that all versions compute the correct dot product. The performance
  difference between versions will be negligible, and in fact may favor the first
  version you run.</P>
<P>A more significant test of performance requires  longer vectors. The files
  <a href="v10.txt" target="v10">v10.txt</a> ... <a href="v10000.txt" target="v10000">v10000.txt</a> define
  progressively longer vectors filled with random numbers. (These files were,
  in turn, created by the spreadsheet <a href="vectors.xlsx" target="vectors">vectors.xlsx</a>.)
  Test each version by redirecting input from the same test file; the output
  roughly compares the performance of each
  version:</P>
<pre>
... tc]$ <span class="userTyped">./tcv0 &lt; v10000.txt</span>
-29.956666 computed by tcv0 in 0.001591 seconds.
... tc]$ <span class="userTyped">./tcv1 &lt; v10000.txt</span>
-29.956666 computed by tcv1 in 0.001090 seconds.
... tc]$ <span class="userTyped">./tcv2 &lt; v10000.txt</span>
-29.956666 computed by tcv2 in 0.001116 seconds.
... tc]$ <span class="userTyped">./tcv3 &lt; v10000.txt</span>
-29.956666 computed by tcv3 in 0.000975 seconds.</pre>
<P>Notice that simply unrolling the loop (<span class="sourcecode">tcv2</span>)
  does not improve performance on this processor, but
  it makes possible
  the memory manipulations that do.</P>
<P><b>Self-Test</b></P>
<div class="hangingindent"> 
  <P>1.&#9;(1) What can go wrong with versions 2 and 3, if N is an odd number?</P>
  <P> 2.&#9;(1) How can you rearrange the instructions in version 3 to improve
    performance, which still using the same instructions and computing the correct
  answer? Explain your changes.</P>
  <P> 3.&#9;(2) How can you rearrange the instructions in version 3, to show
    the <em>worst</em> possible
    performance, which still using the same instructions and computing the correct
    answer? Explain your changes.</P>
</div>
<P><b>Assignments</b></P>
<P>Take the function you wrote for 
  <script>writeNamedTutorial('dotprod1')</script>, 
  unroll the loop at least once
  and arrange the instructions to reduce pipeline stalls. Test your function
  with data
  of sufficient length that you can measure the difference in performance. You
  do not have to write a second version, <b>tcs</b><u><em>x</em></u><b>v2.s</b>,
  which simply unrolls the loop, but you may find it helpful to do so. Submit <b>tcs</b><u><em>x</em></u><b>v3.s</b>, <b>tcs</b><u><em>x</em></u><b>m.cpp</b> (which
  may be a copy of <b>t9s</b><u><em>x</em></u><b>m.cpp</b>), and a log file <b>tcs</b><u><em>x</em></u><b>v3.log</b> that
  shows a performance comparison on a long data sample. </P>
