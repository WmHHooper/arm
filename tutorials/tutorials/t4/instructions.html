<h1>t4: Addressing Modes, Part II</h1>
<script>wNavbar()</script>
<p> This tutorial illustrates the <I>auto-indexed mode</I> of addressing, the 
  other major form of indirect addressing on the ARM processor. This mode is important 
  for structured data, such as arrays or files of records, and it is also important 
  as a way of manipulating the stack. </p>
<P>Link the files 
  <a href="t4.s" target="t4">t4.s</a> and 
  <a href="t4m.cpp" target="t4m">t4m.cpp</a> into 
  your project and examine them. First, some notes on 
  <a href="t4m.cpp" target="t4m">t4m.cpp</a>:</P>
<div class="hangingindent"> 
  <P>16-20: This is a conventional C++ record definition. The fields within this 
    record are arranged as follows:</P>
  <P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="Image5.gif" WIDTH=290 HEIGHT=30></P>
  <P>&#9;For example, the "name" field occupies bytes 0 through 6, etc. The gray 
    bytes between fields reflect the <I>alignment</I> of records. Thus, a byte 
    is skipped so that the "score" field will begin on an even byte, and two bytes 
    are skipped so that the id will begin on a location divisible by four.</P>
  <P>22-30: The array CSC123[ ] contains seven records. This multi-line declaration
     sizes the array and initialize its contents at the same time. Together,
    the  array declaration and the structure definition produce a data structure
    with  the layout:</P>
  <P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="image6.png" WIDTH=366 HEIGHT=41></P>
  <P>30: The Scores[] array is seven short integers, two bytes each.</P>
  </div>
  
<p>The rest of the program is a little different from the other tutorials, in
  that it asks for no input other than an Enter to proceed. The important part
  is that it calls CopyScores to copy each score from the CSC123[ ]array to the
Scores[ ] array. </p>
<p>The implementation of CopyScores, in 
  <a href="t4.s" target="t4">t4.s</a> is more interesting.
  When the function is called,
  <span class="register">r0</span> contains
  N, while registers <span class="register">r1</span> 
  and <span class="register">r2</span> point to the beginning of arrays S[ ] and R[ ], respectively. 
</p>
<div class="hangingindent"> 
  <p>15: This rather odd instruction causes <span class="register">r2</span> to point behind the array, to
    the field R[-1].score.  We'll see why--I promise!</p>
  <p>16: This load instruction illustrates <i>pre-increment</i> addressing. 16
     is added to <span class="register">r2</span> get the effective address of the object R[0].score,
      which is loaded into <span class="register">r3</span>. The exclamation point (!) causes the new
      address  to be written back into <span class="register">r2</span> as a side effect of the instruction.
      The  next time around the loop, the instruction will compute the effective
      address  of R[1].score, and so on. Note that the <span class="sourcecode">h</span> prefix in
      this instruction  causes it to load a half-word (16 bits), rather than
      the default full-word  (32) bits.</p>
  <P>18: This instruction illustrates <i>post-increment</i> addressing. The value 
    in 
    <span class="register">r3</span> is stored in the address at 
    <span class="register">r1</span>, without any adjustment. 
    Meanwhile 
    <span class="register">r1</span>
    is being updated by adding 2. Thus the value is being 
    stored at the S[0], while the register is updated to point to S[1]. The next 
    time around the loop, the value will store at S[1] while the register moves 
    to S[2], and so on.</P>
</div>
<P> Compile and run the program. The output is simply a one-line list of the
  array 
  <span class="sourcecode">Scores</span>, to which the scores were copied from
  the <span class="sourcecode">CSC123</span> array. Run the gdb 
  debugger on the program, setting a breakpoint at CopyScores. The .gdbinit file
   has been set up to show values similar to the following:</P>
<pre>...
6: x/8xb $r1
0x112f8 &lt;Scores>:    0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00
5: x/32xb $r2
0x11164 &lt;CSC123>:    0x41 0x6e 0x6e 0x61 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00
0x1116c &lt;CSC123+8>:  0x5b 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x9c 0x58 0x26 0x15
...</pre>
<p>The array S[ ] to which 
<span class="register">r1</span> points is initally zeroed--a behavior which
is  NOT guaranteed! The first record of R[ ] begins with the ASCII characters
'A',  'n', 'n', and 'a', just as we would expect. Eight bytes from the beginning
of  the record, we find the value 91 (=0x5b) stored in little-endian order. Stepping
 forward twice, we subtract 8, then add 16 to 
  <span class="register">r2</span>, while putting the halfword 
  in <span class="register">r3</span>:</p>
<pre>...
5: x/32xb $r2
0x1116c &lt;CSC123+8>:  0x5b 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x9c 0x58 0x26 0x15
...
4: /x $r3 = 0x5b
...</pre>
The value <span class="sourcecode">0x5b</span> appears to have moved,
but if you check the addresses you can verify that the memory location hasn't
changed, only the value of 
<span class="register">r2</span>. Step again, and we should see 
<span class="register">r3</span> stored in S[0]--but
we don't because 
<span class="register">r1</span> no longer points to S[0]. If we continue to step through
the loop, we will see 
<span class="register">r2</span> advance 1 record at a time, until we continue.
